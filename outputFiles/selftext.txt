While vaccines are starting to be administered in several countries, the coronavirus (COVID-19) situation continues to have a major effect on travel, with many now looking to understand if, when, or how their travels might be feasible. Accordingly, /r/travel is continue its megathreads on a monthly basis until the crisis dissipates.  In the interest of reducing the number of one-off questions, **before you post a question about how to deal with your individual travel plans, consider whether your situation is adequately addressed by the following:**  ## Are borders open? What entry or transit restrictions are in place? Will I need to quarantine?  A list of travel restrictions can be found in a number of sources, including from [IATA](https://www.iatatravelcentre.com/international-travel-document-news/1580226297.htm) or [Kayak's travel restriction map](https://www.kayak.com/travel-restrictions). Note that IATA only deals with travel restrictions by air (so it will not speak to any land border restrictions or closures).  You may also do well to check out government and embassy sources from the destination country (and sometimes from your own embassy in the destination country). **Because information can change on short notice, it is important to verify the latest information, ideally from government sources.**  ## ...in the US?  At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are prohibited from entering or transiting the US if they have been in *or transited* via Brazil, China, India, Iran, Ireland,  the Schengen Area, South Africa, or the UK in the preceding 14 days. Exceptions to this rule include green card holders, some family members of US citizens and permanent residents, and holders of certain visas (e.g. F-1 visas when traveling from the Schengen Area, and K-1 visas). *Note that (except for, of course, US citizens) this is not a citizenship-based restriction; it is purely based on travel history.* **Because of this, those traveling from one of the restricted countries are permitted to enter the US provided they spend the prior two weeks in a non-restricted country.** More information about the entry restrictions and the associated proclamations is available on the [US CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html).  **All air passengers – regardless of origin, nationality, and vaccination status – [need to produce a negative result](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html)** from a viral test taken within 3 days of the first flight on a single ticket to the US. Alternatively, you may travel with a positive test result from the previous 3 months and a letter from a doctor indicating that you're clear for travel. The land borders with Mexico and Canada are closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes, but [air, rail, and sea (but not commuter rail or ferry) ports-of-entry remain open](https://ca.usembassy.gov/travel-restrictions-fact-sheet/) to non-essential travel.  No nationwide quarantine requirements exist. Some individual states and/or cities may have their own guidelines, even for domestic travel, so you will need to confirm with information from your destination state or city. However, at this point, these quarantine guidelines are primarily recommendations instead of requirements (with those for Hawaii being the major exception). **Note also that COVID tests are not being demanded at check-in, security, boarding, or arrival for domestic travel within the contiguous United States, and checkpoints are not being set up at state borders.**  For more information, see [the US CDC's COVID-19 page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/index.html).  ## ...in Canada?  At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering Canada unless they are traveling for certain, mostly essential reasons, *regardless of mode of travel*. Those traveling from countries other than the US must also fulfill one of several additional categories of exemptions. Those who are permitted to travel to Canada for non-essential purposes include – aside from Canadians – permanent residents and certain family members of Canadians and permanent residents. Note that Canadian airlines will be halting flights to Mexico and the Caribbean. Those wishing to travel to Canada on compassionate reasons may do so provided they receive authorization from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Fully airside international transits are typically permitted.  All passengers five years or older arriving into Canada by air will also need to [produce a negative result from a PCR test](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying) taken within 72 hours prior to boarding the last direct flight to Canada. Alternatively, you may submit a positive COVID-19 molecular test taken between 14 and 90 days prior to departure. Note that   Passengers are required to take an additional test on arrival and quarantine at hotels for at least three days, pending negative test results, in one of four cities – Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Montreal – that will serve as the only ports-of-entry by air. After being permitted to exit hotel quarantine, travelers must continue to self-quarantine until 14 days after arrival, at which point they must take another test. The whole process is expected to cost approximately C$2000 per passenger, which travelers will have to pay.   For more information, see [the Canadian government's COVID-19 travel restrictions page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/coronavirus-covid19/travel-restrictions-exemptions.html).  ## ...in Mexico?  At the time of writing, there are no changes to Mexico's standard entry requirements. However, the land border with the United States is officially closed to all except those travelling for essential purposes. Travelers must fill out a "Questionnaire of Identification of Risk Factors in Travelers", available here, to present upon arrival. There are no quarantine or testing requirements upon arrival in Mexico.  For more information, see information provided by Mexican embassies, including the [Mexican Embassy in the Netherlands](https://embamex.sre.gob.mx/paisesbajos/index.php/foreign-nationals/frequent-questions).  ## ...in the UK?  At the time of writing, *foreign nationals* are barred from entering the UK if they have entered or transited several several countries -- including, but not limited to, South American countries, South Asian countries, Panama, Qatar, Turkey, the UAE, and several countries in southern Africa -- within the previous 10 days are not permitted to enter the UK. The [full "red list" of countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#red-list) is subject to change. Irish citizens and those with UK resident permits are, in addition to UK nationals, exempted from this restriction.  All passengers entering or transiting through the UK from outside the Common Travel Area (which comprises the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands) need to produce a negative PCR, LAMP, or antigen test taken within 3 days of their last direct flight (or other mode of transit) to the UK. Those who have only been/transited in ["green list" countries](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#green-list) in the previous ten days are not required to quarantine, although they must still take a COVID-19 test the second day after arrival. *The restriction is based on travel history, not nationality.* All other international arrivals (including UK citizens) will need to quarantine for 10 days after arrival. Passengers who have not been/transited in any of the red list countries over the previous ten days may shorten their quarantines in England if they [test negative](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-test-to-release-for-international-travel) at least 5 days into their quarantine period. In England, passengers are also [permitted to leave quarantine to depart the country](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-quarantine-when-you-arrive-in-england#quarantine-for-10-days-after-you-arrive).  Unless falling under the "green list" exemption, all travelers, regardless of nationality, coming from outside the Common Travel Area will, in addition to getting tested before departure, need to take a test on the second and eighth days after arrival. These tests need to be [pre-booked before departure](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/).   All travelers that have been/transited in any of the "red list" countries over the previous ten days must book, at their own expense, a hotel room for their quarantine. For those destined for Scotland, *all travelers* who have been outside the Common Travel Area in the previous ten days must book a hotel room for their quarantines. These hotel rooms must be [booked in advance](https://quarantinehotelbookings.ctmportal.co.uk/), along with the mandatory tests on the second and eighth days of quarantine.  With "lockdown" measures in place within the UK, there may be restrictions on travel purposes to, from, or within the constituent countries. For example, [travel to and from Scotland is prohibited](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-on-travel-and-transport/) except for limited purposes.  For more information, see [UK Border Control](https://www.gov.uk/uk-border-control) and the [UK government's information about travel measures](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/transport-measures-to-protect-the-uk-from-variant-strains-of-covid-19).  ## ...in the EU? In the Schengen Area?  In late June 2020, the European Commission recommended that external borders be reopened to short-term visitors arriving from several countries deemed to have adequately maintained the virus. This [list has been updated](https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/travel-during-coronavirus-pandemic_en), as of May 6, to consist of Australia, China (subject to confirmation of reciprocity), Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand. This list, however, is non-binding among member countries and is subject to change.  Nevertheless, several countries within the EU or the Schengen Area have used this list as guidance, permitting arrivals from these countries as well as "EU+" countries (which includes EU and Schengen countries, and sometimes the UK). These restrictions typically are not based on nationality but rather travel history and/or residency; consult resources from your destination country. However, multiple EU countries have temporarily placed additional restrictions on travel from specific countries (e.g. the UK) or have reinstated broad restrictions for those from outside the EU, the Schengen Area, or their own countries due to discoveries of new COVID variants. Fully airside non-Schengen to non-Schengen transits are typically permitted, but confirm and consult resources from your transit country to see if further documentation (which may, at times, include negative test results) is required. For  example, **Germany's transit requirements** are discussed [here](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/travel-restrictions-border-control/travel-restriction-border-control-list.html#f13919566) and [here](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268#content_5).  **In May 2021, the European Commission recommended EU states loosen travel restrictions, including by allowing vaccinated travelers to travel to Europe this summer.** However, details about these plans are still being unveiled, and each EU country has the ultimate say on its border policies. **Among the European countries that have reopened to vaccinated travelers are [France](https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/coronavirus-advice-for-foreign-nationals-in-france/#sommaire_1) (although with limitations from "red" countries), [Greece](https://travel.gov.gr/#/), [Iceland](https://www.landlaeknir.is/um-embaettid/greinar/grein/item44162/Certificate-of-vaccinat.ion-against-COVID-19-accepted-at-the-border), and [Spain](https://twitter.com/SpainInTheUSA/status/1401155037297090564).** This list is not exhaustive, and some countries are also loosening some restrictions for unvaccinated tourists.  As the various EU and Schengen countries have opened their external borders to third-country nationals in various ways and with different exceptions, it is imperative that travelers check the entry requirements for their ports-of-entry. A summary of travel restrictions is [provided by the European Union](https://reopen.europa.eu/en), but many have reported that government (e.g. embassy or foreign ministry) resources have been more detailed and accurate.  ## ...in South Korea?  At the time of writing, [most nationalities](http://viewer.moj.go.kr/skin/doc.html?rs=/result/bbs/229&amp;fn=temp_1586503947805100) with visa-free or visa-waiver arrangements with Korea have had their visa-free/waiver status suspended, primarily on the basis of the reciprocal entry restrictions for Korean citizens. There are also additional entry and transit restrictions of those traveling from China.  All passengers must have a negative LAMP, PCR, SDA, or TMA test taken within 72 hours of departure of the first flight en route to Korea. International arrivals, with very few exceptions, will be required to quarantine for 14 days; non-residents will be required to quarantine in government facilities at their own expense.  For more information, see the [Korea Immigration Service](http://www.immigration.go.kr/immigration_eng/index.do).  ## ...in Japan?  At the time of writing, foreign nationals who have been in one of 150+ countries for purposes other than transit are not permitted to enter Japan. Further, visas and visa exemptions for nationals from many countries have been suspended. Permanent residents, long-term residents, and spouses and children of Japanese citizens may be exempt from these entry restrictions provided they meet certain conditions.  Those individuals, including Japanese citizens, that are permitted to enter Japan will be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine. All travelers will be required to provide proof of a negative result from a test taken within 72 hours of departure for Japan. Additional restrictions are in place for those travelling from the UK or South Africa.  For more information, see the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/ca/fna/page4e_001053.html).  ## ...in Thailand?  At the time of writing, Thailand is accepting travelers that have the proper visa or are visa-exempt. Visa-on-arrival facilities, as well as visa-exempt status for nationals of Cambodia and Myanmar, are suspended. Travelers entering or transiting Thailand must have a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of the first embarkation point.  All travelers entering the country are subject to a 14-day quarantine. Foreigners must have a confirmed hotel reservation for their quarantine and well as health insurance with coverage of at least US$100,000.  ## When will borders reopen or travel restrictions be lifted? Is it safe/a good idea to book travel for a particular time months ahead?  It is, of course, impossible to say when travel restrictions are lifted for every country. Where no news has been officially provided, it is often very difficult to predict as countries will make decisions based on the progress of the pandemic – which is an unknown – as well as other pressures (e.g. economic or social). Consider that the progress of the pandemic and efforts to combat it are unpredictable.  **Countries are approaching the vaccine rollouts in different ways.** Some countries are exempting vaccinated travelers from testing or quarantine requirements, and some are even allowing vaccinated travelers to enter when they would not admit unvaccinated travelers. However, one should not assume special treatment on account of your vaccinated status, as most countries still have not differentiated between vaccinated and unvaccinated travelers.  In the meantime, with the resurgences of cases and new variants recently discovered in several countries, some countries have firmed up travel restrictions, requiring additional tests or quarantine periods or preventing travel from certain locations. Further, even if you are ultimately able to travel to your destination, there may be "lockdowns" or widespread closures of businesses and places of interest.  Realize that you are taking a risk by deciding to speculatively book travel in the hopes that travel restrictions will be lifted by the time you travel, or even will remain as liberal as they are in your destination today. With this unprecedented situation, old adages about when it's best to purchase airfare may no longer be valid. In any event, be aware of the policies of your airlines and accommodations for credits and/or refunds should you need to reschedule or cancel.  Further, understand that airlines may make it very difficult to receive a refund, even if legally required. Many travelers have reported waiting months to receive refunds on cancelled flights or otherwise being stonewalled when requesting a refund. And be aware that if your airline goes out of business, your funds could be lost forever.  Take note of your jurisdiction's laws regarding refunds for cancelled flights. For example:  * [US Dept of Transportation: Refunds](https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds) * [EU: Air passenger rights](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm)  ## So should I cancel a trip that I've already booked? And how? Will insurance help?  These questions were covered at length in the [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/fjhjoz/coronavirus_megathread_for_travelrelated/).

Curious as to why Moderna isn't more effective than Pfizer given the amount of vaccine in Moderna is much higher (100 microunits vs 30 microunits). I've done quite a bit of research and my understanding is the lipid that it is in isn't as "optimized", but even as such, I'm surprised 3X the amount of vaccine still can't get it to be more effective.   Does anybody know?

My partner was a bit rough when we got frisky last night and I woke in the middle of the night with a dull but ever-present pain in my right testicle. I managed to get back to sleep but the pain is still there this morning. The pain is mostly in the piping but the ball hurts a bit as well, bringing with it that same bottom-of-the-stomach nausea that comes after a hit to the groin.  The pain is enough that I would normally trot off to my GP to ask what’s up but I’m stuck in hotel quarantine for another couple of days. Is this something I can ride out and hope goes away or should I try to see a doctor despite the quarantine?

The pandemic gave me an excuse to take a breather and focus on myself for awhile. It really helped. But now that I'm vaccinated, I'm feeling the pressure again to get back into life. I'm pushing myself to participate in things that truly overwhelm me, and I feel shame because, despite being medicated and all of my daily hard work, my body and mind are completely rejecting this. It's bullshit.   I would like to be able to attend a social gathering or appointment without feeling like shit. Or having to find the acceptable time and space to recover from it before moving onto the next thing.

   I'm wondering how data scientists and data analysts are approaching this unique problem of markedly lower numbers (of anything) from the pandemic.  For example, is there a way to answer the question of "I understand that our revenues were low between March - June, but if there wasn't a pandemic, what would they have been?"  Assuming I have data from January 2019 to present June 2021 is there a standardized way to solve for this?  I was thinking I could use the averages from March 2019 - June 2019 combined with the averages between March 2021 - June 2021 and find the difference to March 2020 - June 2020.  Has anyone encountered a problem trying to solve this already?  Thanks!

Seriously, I (unfortunately) come across so many people who feel the need to "educate" others about how this pandemic is used as a means to get people to live in fear. These people go on about COVID's high survival rate under a certain age, yet will tell people to fear the vaccine and to not get it because of certain side effects that occur in a small number of people.  I have nothing against being cautious, asking questions, and making informed decisions. This is solely for the type of people stated above.

Hello I was wondering about getting the coronavirus vaccination. I heard that people who are teens and young adults got heart problems like heart inflammation after their second shot. I’m in that age demographic and I was wondering if it’s safe to get that vaccine. Would I risk getting bad health problems or even possible death because I never had the coronavirus before and if got the vaccine would I get some kind of bad reaction to it. What do you think is the better idea in your opinion? I mean I don’t have a pre existing medical disorders that I know of. I was just wondering if it’s safe to get it that’s all because I don’t want to get sick and die from it.

If you happen to be one of the “lucky” who wins one of the million dollar lottery jackpots (a ticket, for which, can only be obtained by choosing to get the vaxx) your name and likeness will be broadcast publicly. That’s just a part of the overall deal you’ve agree to, but the official reason for why it has to be done like has stood out to me as BS from the very start.   The official reason is that if you don’t collect your winnings in public and they don’t identify you to the entire then people would be left to wonder if the lottery organizers were favoring their friends and family/giving the prizes out to people they know. In other words, it might have been rigged.  That they even took the time to tell us this struck me as odd and unnecessary. Did anybody really have a fear of this or was it even something that’s so likely to happen there needed to be an official policy in place to thwart it?  I never assumed the winners were going to be anonymous, because that doesn’t fulfill the ultimate purpose which is to make more people get the vaccine. I mean, that’s pretty much the universally accepted agenda behind stuff like the lotteries is it not? I think we can all agree on that.   And what serves that agenda best? Not having some nameless, faceless person collect their vaccine prize. What serves their agenda is having the public see some smiling, happy person get rewarded in a way we all would want to experience. It makes it real, it’s relatable, and it reminds us, “Hey, this could have been me!”   To that end the fact that the first public winner to be thrust into the spotlight was as “perfect” as they come (really pretty girl next door type who was on her way to buy a new car when she got the news she’d won a million dollars and would no longer have to worry about car troubles) almost sounds like something they’d be more likely rig than cheating so the prize goes out to their friends and family.   To be clear, I’m not saying anything was actually rigged. The suggestion never even crossed my mind. But I don’t have a clue who is in charge of these vaccine lotto contests but I would assume the people behind them are those who are already in a position of money and power. And we don’t have some ingrained distrust of public lotteries or collectively suspect lotteries of being rigged in general so it seems like they’re going out of their way to explain something no one is even asking about in the first place.

  It is a possible scenario that China or international groups that support totalitarianism released this pathogens purposefully. Either that or FINANCIAL interests. See the results of this pandemic, governments around the world imposing draconian authoritarian measures that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. Banning people from getting out of their own homes, forbidding most businesses from operating, forbidding people from going out to work, banning protests and religious services, banning meeting each other.     The completely totalitarian measures taken all over the world have the hallmarks of groups who support totalitarianism and complete government control over citizens. It really is a possibility that this was a bio-terror attack. Not only governments can impose incredible authoritarian measures with the support of most of the population, but big banks have been lending money in the TRILLIONS, dwarfing by far the profits of big pharma. All the while mega corporations consolidate their power with the elimination of thousands and thousands of small and medium competitors. There is MANY people who have A LOT A LOT to gain with this pandemic.

We all know about the short term, flu- like side effects from the vaccine. However i hear about a lot of serious side effects. for example a family friend’s husband is currently hospitalized 10 days after his second pfizer shot for dangerously high fever &amp; extreme body weakness. Why is this not more talked about? why is it when people get serious, possible life threatening symptoms from this vaccine, it’s just brushed off? These very serious side effects are becoming concerningly more common but not talked about what so ever. Not an anti vaxxer by any means. i’m actually 17 days fully vaccinated myself. but seeing more and more people come up with very serious side effects really makes you question.

Caucasian female, 47 Hi, I’m due for my 2nd dose of Astra Zeneca 16.June but now need to travel to NZ on the 12th (3.5 hours flying time) as my Dad is on his way out. I had the flu shot on Sunday so if I wait the required 2 weeks then that puts it on the 13th even if I got it early. With the blood clot issues I don’t want to not wait the full 2 weeks, nor do I want to have it a day before I fly.  New Zealand only has the Pfizer vaccine so I would be mixing vaccines.  In your opinion, is it best to mix the vaccines and have the 2nd dose on schedule or should I have the second dose 4 weeks late?  Thanks in advance for any advice you can give.

i got the second pfizer shot a few weeks ago, and just got my period today. it came earlier than it usually would have, and my cramps are the worst they’ve ever been, to the point where i don’t want to walk because it’s so painful. has anyone else experienced this?

18F. I’m having extreme anxiety about getting the second dose that I’ve even been thinking about canceling it. I just know I’m gonna be in a state of panic even days after I get it and I’m just not ready for that. Can someone please tell me why I should still get it or can someone reassure me that I’d be okay with just one dose, if I will? Thank you.

First off, I've had my first dose already so I'm not one of those covidiots or anti-vaxxers or anything, but I'm just uncomfortable with my landlord demanding that kind of information from me. I've told him already that I've received my first dose, but he wants proof.  Do I have to show him proof? I have a laundry list of other complaints about this landlord, such as him charging me extra for power consumption when utilities are included in the rent, but I'll keep this about the vaccine info for now.  Edit for some additional context: I live in a basement suite and the landlord lives upstairs. I doubt that matters but I just thought I'd mention that.  Update: Sooo this happened 👀 https://www.citynews1130.com/2021/06/04/burnaby-renter-landlord-proof-covid-19-vaccine/

I am not TTC yet so I’m hoping it’s ok to post this here. So today I had a doctors appointment completely unrelated to TTC and my doctor had a look at my latest labs which were the ones I got done when I first brought up TTC in November. I never got a call back which means “everything is fine”. However, today she said that I do not have Rubella immunity and I need to get the MMR shot and wait 3 months before TTC. I also need to wait 2 weeks between covid vaccine and any other vaccines. So now I’m stressing!! My covid vaccine is next week, so I’ll have to have my MMR shot in 3 weeks and then wait 3 months to try. That’s gonna push my timeline by a month which I guess is no big deal if it means I’m gonna be protected agains dangerous diseases but I’m sooo annoyed! I’ve literally been counting down the days to start.   I was having a look online and other subreddits and a lot of people said their doctors told them to only wait one month after the MMR vaccine. Even official sites say 1 month. So I’m having hope that maybe I can get away with waiting 2 months? Am I stressing for nothing?

Assalam 3alaykum wa rahmat Allah.    As you can probably tell, this is about the Mufti Abu Layth Muhammad or "MALM" to his fans. \* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\* - \*\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, \*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\* \* \*:\* \*\*\* \*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*-\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*.  (As I write this, I realize the tone is much like the esteemed Shaykh Yasir Qadhi and so you may find yourself reading it in his voice 😁.)    However, I am very concerned in the approach of your polemic regarding him. I understand that reformation is only possible in Islamic fiqh where there is valid qiyas (interpretive reasoning) and daleel (religious and sometimes medical evidence) for it. My concerns are for the social welfare of the Ummah as regards the contents of your polemic.    [https://youtu.be/euukc93CIw4](https://youtu.be/euukc93CIw4)    My brother, why have you not sought to guide this brother by means of email and invitations to your channel? Why haven't the usual avenues of scholarly resolution been exhausted before spoken polemics had been taken? Why have we forsaken the processes of disputation established by the scholars in accordance with the Salaf, and resorted to spectacle, misfortune and tribulation instead?    It is not meet to publicly call someone else who makes the Shahâda a charlatan and a innovator, until you've had a chance to debate and discuss on the fiqh affair at hand (with a third, knowledgeable moderating party). The layman does not know the conditions for this action and may copy this behaviour in other situations, taking them out of the fold of Islam.    We must look to the 'ulamâ for examples on how to deal with this, and a great example lies in Ibn Taymiyyah (r.a).    Ibn Taymiyyah debated the Maturidis in Damascus by means of munazarah (public forum) before his fatwa declaring their aqidah as heretical. This was ordered by a neutral body - the governor of Damascus, r.a. Even after imprisonment, he never demanded the overthrow of the the jury, the qadi and imams who pushed him out from Damascus.    He poured years of effort discouraging Muslims from using Hellenistic philosophy and metaphorism in theistic creed (Tawhid). He showed Sabr and resorted to Khutbahs on the Maturidi leadership a number of years following his first written polemics. By \\*writing\\* his content in the way Al-Munajjid and Abu Amina Elias do, he has held to the scholarly tradition and kept the layman out of his siyâsah.    My brother in Islam, fear Allah despite \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\* \*\* that man. Do not engage him in ways that cause fitnah masîbah and siyâsah for the Ummah, and cause the layman to attack those viewed as learned and scholarly by video and physical means, even the \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\* \*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\* \*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*'\* \*\*\*\*\*.    It may be ideal to take the video private and to discuss our conversation with your viewers if you agree with me.    Oh Allah! I bear witness it was not ordered nor effected by me and I took no pleasure from that affair, and you are amongst us in that Witness!    I seek forgiveness in Allah for me and you from all sin, and may He forgive—for he is the Oft-Forgiving, the Merciful.    Thanks for reading. Wassalam alayk wa ala rasulih il-karim, SAAW.  *Some content redacted to pass the local guidelines. This was sent by email T2021-05-21.*

Has anyone had covid vaccine who's not eligible for Medicare? How does that vaccination record will go to my health record.  I read somewhere that you can have Individual Healthcare Identifier and register for my health record, which I did.  At my vaccination site, they were only asking for Medicare. When I said that I have IHI, receptionist looks confused and said its fine without Medicare.  I had my vaccine but just wondering if anyone knows about vaccination proof in this case.

Both my folks are in their late 70's and therefore signed up for the vaccine as soon as it was available.  Although I am waiting on more data before I consider it for myself, I supported my folks getting the shot(s) as they are certainly at risk.  My dad is a retired M.D. (ENT), type II diabetic, suffers from gout, glaucoma, overweight (probably meets the medical definition of obese), some arterial blockages especially to the kidneys, and takes high blood pressure medication so not exactly the picture of good health but still gets around and is active outside in the summer or in warmer climes when he does the winter snowbird thing.  In retrospect he also thinks he \*may\* have possibly gotten the coronavirus in January 2020 but is not sure. Was on a flight and next to someone coughing/hacking really bad. Days later he started coughing, had congestion in the lungs, and could actually hear wheezing coming from his lungs. Had mentioned he had never had wheezing in the lungs before.  Because he had part of a previous winter trip ruined with a gout attack stranding him in bed for nearly two weeks, he had started taking some colchicine prophylactically to prevent the travel stress from setting one off. Only in hindsight with recent studies have we discovered colchicine may have positive therapeutic effects limiting severity of covid. Anyway, all of this is circumstantial but I thought it may be important and provide a more complete context.    Both my parents were given the Pfizer jabs. First jab was nothing. My mom did have some soreness in the arm but otherwise neither of my parents had anything to speak of.  After getting their second jab my mom was a bit tired and wiped out the next day but bounced right back. My dad began having severe pain behind the knee, later emanating down his calf. Having a medical background he pretty much knew it was one of two things - either a DVT, or a ruptured bakers cyst. After several days he was convinced it was a DVT because of the lack of any discoloration or other signs of a ruptured bakers cyst.  I don't know if any of you have doctors/retired MDs in the family but my dad doesn't go to doctors for anything unless forced to by my mom, if there's nothing that can really be done about the situation anyway.  He just laid up on the sofa for the next week or so, elevated the leg, did the circulation exercises and hoped for the best, telling us "well if you find me dead here, just means the clot dislodged and stopped my heart" blah blah.  Long story short, the clot obviously dissolved with time and a week later he was back on his feet.  He also developed some circulatory issues in his third toe on the same leg several weeks later.  Can't rule out the type II diabetes and poor circulation and I'm no doctor but he was worried the toe was going bad and might turn gangrenous &amp; have to lop it off.  He kept it clean, did the "wiggle your toes every hour", made sure to massage it periodically and that resolved itself too.  TL/DR: Nothing clinically confirmed but suspected DVT in the leg and possible peripheral clotting causing poor blood circulation in one toe following the second Pfizer jab. Self-diagnosis from retired ENT surgeon. Full recovery and nothing else to report in the month or two since.

I know there have probably been a bajillion posts about this, but I’m going crazy trying to decide if I should get my vaccine or not.   Here’s my situation: I’m 23 weeks pregnant and I am considered very low risk to getting covid because I work outside (and 99% of the time I’m alone), and I live in the country and the closest city of 30,000 people has 4 active cases.   If I was in a higher risk area or had a higher risk of exposure at my job I would 100% get the vaccine. I understand that the risk of the vaccine is very low compared to the known high risk of getting covid while pregnant. But I’m having a really hard time justifying the risk of the vaccine with my low risk of getting covid.  I have an appointment this coming Saturday to get my first dose. I’m in Canada where doses are being given 4 months apart so this is my ideal window to get it (also having to time it with the Tdap shot). I feel like it’s now or never to make this decision which really sucks.  I understand relatively well how the vaccine works and that long term effects to the baby are highly unlikely and that there’s no evidence that the vaccine crosses the placenta. But I’m still nervous to take the risk even if it’s tiny. Ugh.   I’ve spoken with my healthcare provider but unfortunately it was really not helpful. They basically said that it’s a personal choice and up to me to decide.   Anyone who was also low risk have any advice? I’d really appreciate it … I’m really struggling with this decision.

When I was younger I had a decent friend group. Now over time that withered away to two original friends, some college friends with extremely limited contact and thats it. I always was introverted when growing up and never did much other than hobbies alone etc.Its not also that I did not want to but more people being not exactly respectful that left me with no choice but to leave. Had huge social anxiety also and then in middle school had depression until college where I was actually diagnosed.   I took one job out of college for 6 months and it was useless so I left, I then went to work for another job and felt very anxious all day after a year and there was zero room for pay increases so I left.   I now took another job with only a slight pay increase and benefits working part time over my old one with no benefits part time.   I feel like failure in a way. I have limited social interactions, feel bored and depressed at night even though I try often and then just....dont know what else to do. I feel like days go by and I just did not do that much.  Ive been to therapy but I feel like it does not help. Im already on medication for other stuff too. It is not limiting just..degrading I guess.    Has anyone had it hard during the pandemic? has anyone had something that helped them? etc. I know that I have had it easier than most but as it has shown, having covid or having lack of social interaction has been linked to a huge rise in depression.

I'm a 15+ year chronic migraneur and have tried almost every med and treatment there is. Already failed with Aimovig and now I'm onto Ajovy. Just did the shot in my stomach today, 225mg. Hoping for the best. I have a migraine over half the month currently and other health issues.   It hurt quite a bit but if it lowers my migraine frequency I will be so happy. Its been so hard just to keep living and feel any sort of personal worth when dealing with this debilitating shit!!  Thanks for listening to my rant...just hopeful for a new med!

By splitting a dxm dose in 2, and taking half of it a few hours after the first one, you can essentially get high on a completely different drug, or well, that's how it feels.   DXM, the active ingredient in cough syrup, breaks down into DXO, the more recreational metabolite of dxm. DXM is an SRI, stimulating, buzzy, can causes lots of geometric visuals similar to psychedelics. DXO, is primarily an NMDA antagonist, this causes the profound euphoria, feelings of dissociation, feeling like you're floating or flying, in a different room or space, or watching yourself. DXM turns into DXO, so when there's a lot of DXO there's very little DXM. As you may have noticed, combining these 2 drugs sounds like an awesome time right? And it sure as hell is, and can be done by simply taking more dxm a little after the first dose has begun to kick in.   This has given me the most magical trips of my life by far. I think it could be the key to getting the magic back to dxm for some of those who've lost it. It's only on these redosing experiences that I had shit like flying straight through my wall with my eyes open into a giant purple void with skyscraper tall beings walking around. Stuff like that never happens on a single dose for me. I also find this method works far better for treating depression if you are self medicating, but it can unfortunately increase derealization, which, if that's a big problem for you dissociatives are probably not the way to go.

I had a very stressful episode today and my burning brain became unbearable and even then I didn't take any extra Valium (I take 2.5mg) daily.  Now my body feels weird and some hearbeats feel stronger than others.  Other times I went through a similar scenario I woke up the next day with numb limbs for minutes.  Can the stress from the symptoms while you taper be enough to cause heart or brain damage? If so, I will not fight that hard again to not updose.

I’ve been microdosing pretty consistently for the past 6 weeks. Usually 4/5 days on 3/2 days off.. if can vary.  I’m in lockdown in Melbourne right now and I’d really like to take advantage and do a big trip on shrooms. Usual goal for me is around 5 grams.  Wondering if I’d need to increase due to tolerance? Or really any advice!  Increased micro dose recently to 0.3 - 0.4.  Type is GOLDEN TEACHER ❤️

So I received an email tonight from Mid-West Toronto OHT saying that my second dose was “successfully cancelled” but I never went through any motions to cancel it. It has me a bit concerned. Has any one else experienced this? I revived my first dose mid March and was booked to receive my second dose at the beginning of July.   I am confused because I didn’t cancel it but I know there’s been talks of pushing up second dose appointments to get the process rolling. Hoping that someone else on here might have some insight!

Did she feel any pain during her final moments? We are waiting for the tox report but we believe it was a mixture of opioids and sleeping pills. She’s been so estranged from our family for years because of her drug use and general psychotic behavior with stealing money... so we all feel responsible and guilty in some way. 6 months ago she tried to reach out to me and I told her I had no interest in talking to her :( but I did contact our dad so he would check on her. Idk I’m so confused right now and wish I had at least tried to have a relationship with her, wondering if that would have made a difference.

The government is receiving reservations for Janssen single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for reservists and Civil Defense members over the age of 30. You can choose the date and location of the vaccine through the [KDCA website](https://ncvr.kdca.go.kr/cobk/index.html) and there are 1 million doses to go around.   You can choose your preferred location and date, but since the COVID-19 vaccines of all types are in high demand you may not be served by the vaccination center near you (I, a Seoul citizen, had to book a spot in Gyeonggido).   Our only hope of taking masks off by the end of this year is only if enough people receive their shots. So hurry up and reserve your vaccine people.

Hey there everyone!  My name's Anthony! I'm a Canadian who made the bold move to accept a promotion at the end of the 2019 and end up moving to California (Bay Area/ NorCal) at the beginning of lockdowns which squashed all my ability to meet coworkers (ended up getting moved to different teams twice, now no one on my team is in Cali), and limited by ability to really experience the city. So I really don't know anyone in the city and discord has been my best friend when my friends are online. But, things are opening up and I think it's time to make some new friends or more!  So who am I?  I'm a Canadian in California!  Picture of me being outdoorsy: [https://imgur.com/9K0Zy2Z](https://imgur.com/9K0Zy2Z)  26, 5'11, Blonde, "Fit Dad Bod", grows the worst, patchiest beard ever (shaves always)  What do I like to do?  Video Games! Mostly playing World of Warcraft, Mass Effect (Legendary Edition), and some Baldurs Gate 3  Sports! Toronto Blue Jays, Toronto Maple Leafs (sadly), Formula 1 (oh, yes I wake up at 4am to watch a race)'  Movies and TV Shows; Sci-Fi / Drama / Historical ; So many to name, ask me about what I watch!  Fancy Dinner Club; I use to do a monthly fancy dinenr club back home, where we would get dressed up (though restaurant specific) and go enjoy a new restaurant, get a little bit of everything to share, few bottles of wine or drinks. Just a treat yo self night, but fancy.  Outdoors! I've been a canoe and kayak instructor for 10 years now, so hand me a paddle.  Looking forward to getting travelling once the world begins to return to normal again, bucketlist locations are Spain, Iceland and getting to every baseball stadium.  Mostly looking to see what kind of connections I can make, happy to play games, chat on discord, watch party for some movies and see where things go!

As the title says.   I'm on 50mg Vyvanse and it's great, makes me function like a normal person, and I find taking breaks from it very difficult. I tried to take a break for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and I felt ok emotionally I just really disliked the feeling of having my scatty ADHD brain back lol.   I'm considering trying a psiloscibin microdose on some break days, but I'm worried I may experience some kind of adverse effect having both drugs in my system so soon after the other. Would love to hear other people's experiences.

I hate being the person that floods this sub with covid stuff, but the booking website has just updated with availability for the next 4 weeks, and I know people have been having trouble and waiting to book in.  If you are eligible, follow the link below and book in at the Ford factory. Hurry, because they’re disappearing fast.  https://www.barwonhealth.org.au/coronavirus/booking-a-vaccination

Today I learned that apparently there's no national mandate or policy after vaccination. Shouldn't there be a post-vax policy like at least going WFH for a day or so after vaccination?

Apologies if this is a stupid question.   I work as a pharmacist at a vaccine clinic. I have OCD and I am always paranoid that I did not invert the vials enough. Even if I just finished inverting 10 times a few seconds ago, I'm convinced I didn't invert it enough and will invert it another 10-15 times. For a total of more than 20 inversions.   Also, when a colleague has reconsituted a vial and hands it over to me to draw up, I invert it 10-15 more times even if they tell me they already inverted it.   Of course I invert slowly, gently, steadily. I do NOT shake the vaccine at all.    But now I am paranoid that inverting too many times can somehow damage the vaccine, even if it is done gently.   Should I be worried, or not?

Despite Washington’s support, Monday’s World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on the intellectual property rights exemption for the new crown vaccine did not come closer to being accepted, because some participants are expected to be skeptical of a new draft. #Additionism  &amp;#x200B;  The WTO resumed negotiations on Monday, focusing on a highly anticipated draft amendment submitted last week by India, South Africa and dozens of other developing countries.  &amp;#x200B;  The United States unexpectedly shifted to support patent exemptions earlier this month, which put pressure on the remaining opponents of numerous drugmakers, such as the European Union and Switzerland. But Monday's discussion failed to make a breakthrough. This discussion is the 11th meeting since the original exemption proposal was proposed in October.  The main supporters of the exemption presented their new draft at a private WTO meeting on Monday, allowing key participants to give the first formal feedback on its content.  &amp;#x200B;  About 10 countries, including South Korea and the United Kingdom, continue to express suspicion and demand more time to study the new South Africa/India proposal.  &amp;#x200B;  Three sources close to the meeting believed that there was a problem with the text.  &amp;#x200B;  ADVERTISEMENT  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  "There is a huge gap between this draft exemption and the US proposal," said an anonymous source who participated in the talks. "There will certainly not be a quick solution."  &amp;#x200B;  The scope and duration of the draft exemption may increase the opposition.  &amp;#x200B;  US Trade Representative Dai Qi has previously stated that she is only concerned with increasing the supply of vaccines, but the new draft also includes aspects such as diagnosis, therapy and medical equipment.

Posting here as the Plandemic is the decades conspiracy.  So I get that they work for the public system but this shouldn’t be a caveat for employment surely? How many times would they have turned up with a cold?  In an ideal world they would all walk out and make the government back down but they’re underpaid to begin with so have a choice.. Live on the street or submit to a government injecting an experimental drug in them just to survive.  It’s all just ridiculous.

I broke up with my girlfriend right before covid happened, and then didn’t really get to have that post breakup fun as I mostly didn’t leave the house.  So its safe to say I’m a bit pent up as I haven’t gotten laid in over a year.  Would be nice if it wasn’t a one time thing.  Maybe we can meet up for coffee or something first and then see where things go from there.  I can’t host right now, but would be willing to get a hotel room if you can’t host or don’t want to.

My husband and I are both in our mid 30s, we may or may not have had COVID previously; he had a mystery respiratory illness that gave him pneumonia early on in the pandemic before tests were widely available and I came down with the same thing 2 weeks later.   1st shot: the actual injection was almost completely painless. And I'm really afraid of needles so I was probably tensed up but it still didn't hurt. I had a strange metallic taste reminiscent of salt substitutes (eg potassium chloride) in my mouth for the first day but it went away after that. I felt tired and achey for 2 days, it was mostly cleared up on the 3rd day, and by the 4th day I was back to normal. I did have diarrhea once the day after vaccination but I'd attribute that to my IBS diagnosis. No notable symptoms in the month until the 2nd shot.   2nd shot: basically the same as the first shot, only I also ran a mild fever (about 100-101 F). I took 400 mg ibuprofen twice a day for 3 days and once on the 4th day and that completely dealt with it. I was expecting the 2nd shot to be way worse based on stories I'd read but I'd say it was 10% worse for me at most.   It'll be 2 weeks after the 2nd vaccine this week and I'm super excited! I'm extremely ready to be in public again without worrying about COVID. If they recommend booster shots yearly I'll definitely be getting them. Whatever my husband and I had at the beginning of the pandemic fucking sucked, if it was COVID I don't want it again and if it wasn't COVID then I don't want to find out how bad COVID is!

so the pfizer covid shot got approved for 12-15 year olds. i wanna go back to school happy and safe. problem is, my parents want me to wait 5 YEARS to get vaccinated. by then i would probably have lung issues from covid. how should i convince my parents that i should get vaccinated? I NEED FACTS, NOT A SOB STORY! i already tried the sob story about being healthy and safe but they dont want me to have a serious side effect from the vaccine lik a poor reproductive system. ik that the covid shot may seem like harm for teens but i trust science and so do my parents but they are just scared. advice and facts on why i should get it would be nice

Not sure this is the right forum to ask, apologies if it is incorrect. Just wondering if an apartment building corporation (big one that owns complexes all over USA) say you have to pay 2 months rent to leave early (which is in their contract) but they left last year during pandemic because they couldn't afford it anymore,  is there any way around the large fee?  Edit: the leasing office and finance dept. refuse to negotiate a reduced price

I got my vaccine in Hamilton this past weekend at Winterberry Medical. They just emailed me with a notice that they have lots of appointments available from June 17 to 25. They even have a couple spots available over the next three days.  [https://winterberrymedical.ca/](https://winterberrymedical.ca/)  The clinic was staffed by a friendly group of nurses. The vaccine is Moderna, if that matters to you.  I'm posting this here because I just got notification from a local Shoppers and they booked out in minutes. So it sounds like local supply is still tight.

As many enterprises continue to operate during these troubling times, we’ve all become involuntary guinea pigs of a barely defined new normal. For instance, the elaborate food industry is progressively metamorphosing as larger groups of people now eat at home more and rely on delivery services. Other regular activities have seemed drastically foreign all of a sudden, too. Even consumer buying behaviour is steadily evolving. Many of these trends were expected, while others came as a surprise.

Seriously you literally live with two people who got vaccines  months ago there is no use in waiting. Take the damn fucking shot you stubborn fuck! The frustrating thing is that I expect this from our grandparents because they are old.  I barely understand but allow even our hippie ass cousin and her “flower power” head-ass because she is a hippie and I don’t expect her or her kids to live long anyways to need it. Hell even our parents because they are old and new things make some older people slow to come around. Shit I already know people from the family church don’t have it because they thing god got their back is a good strategy- they aren’t my blood related family! But it’s my twin of all people, this shouldn’t even be a topic worth arguing with you over! I haven’t sat down to dinner with our family because of my job and covid in awhile and I might not ever because you want to play the god damn “my body my choice” card over a damn needle! You ungrateful bastard! I know hate is a strong word but yeah that is how I feel about this! I am just mad at you! Like really what are you waiting on, Jesus to come back and give out free lollipops?!

Hello fellow Sri Lankans!  Recently, I have been offered a scholarship to a prestigious private school in Africa in order to complete the last two years of my secondary education. Unfortunately, the country that I am going to does not offer COVID vaccines at all because the government essentially denies the existence of the virus. I was wondering if there is ANY way to get the vaccine in Sri Lanka before I leave in August. Although it's unethical, I am open to illegally obtaining the vaccine.  I am 16 years old and  would really appreciate any suggestions.  P.S - I know that the MOH officially only vaccinates people over the age of 18.

I’m an Australian myself.  I think many of us would agree that there have been problems with the roll-out, but I’m wondering how it’s affecting other people:  For example, have you been vaccinated, and how was the process?  Which vaccine did you get, and how long did you have to wait?  How did you feel afterwards?  Or, are you still waiting to get an appointment?  Are you concerned about the vaccine, or about the process?  I’m in the last eligible group, so still waiting until I’m offered a chance to get it, but I can’t wait.  I’m going to book in as soon as I can; just curious about others’ experiences.

Hello, I tested positive for covid mid December 2020, my symptoms were mild and I didn’t need to be admitted to a hospital. However, I noticed that since testing positive I have constant sleeping issues. These issues include waking up multiple times in the night, falling asleep anytime of the day which affects driving. I’m also experiencing memory issues, for example, forgetting where I am, what I did yesterday and recent memories. I’ve also noticed a increase in stomach issues where I’m unable to digest any dairy or gluten. Does anyone have similar issues after covid?

**TLDR: I'm a bit "scared" of reaching out to old friends again, especially ones I haven't made contact during the pandemic.**  So during the pandemic, I didn't really make a really good effort to reach out to old friends (from various periods in my life: college, etc.). Some, I exchanged a few texts/messages sporadically, some I didn't exchange a single word. For context, a lot of them are not in the city where I currently live (I've done better with friends who actually live nearby, though not by a lot.)  For a lot of them, I honestly didn't have much contact before the pandemic (outside of friends in the same city), so it's not a change per se, but I feel like I should have at least reached out to them during the pandemic to see how they're doing, if they're doing alright. If anything, people also seemed to reconnect more during the pandemic, as it gave them a break from real life.  The part that "sucks" is that it's not even that I didn't think about them during the pandemic. I definitely did think of reaching out at times, but I ended up not doing so in most cases. I think it was mostly b/c I had a tough time in my own life (won't say too much, but I'll just say I'm in middle of my grad school), so I always felt like I didn't have the mental energy to reconnect w/ old friends---not really feeling like having the whole, "oh what you've been up to" conversation, as my life has been pretty stagnant past few years.  At one point, I visited one of their cities for a few months to live with a family member (this was during lockdown). I feel like I should have at least reached out and connected virtually, but I didn't, having too much stress at work/school, and honestly not having much free time. There were the COVID excuses too, as things were more serious last spring/summer. My friends don't even know I was there for a few months.  Now, everyone's vaccinated, pandemic's coming to an end, and now it feels almost too late to reach out. Some of you say, ya, they're not your "true" friends if there wasn't contact either way during the pandemic. Ok, maybe we weren't that close to begin with, but regardless of the label, the facts are: I do wish to keep in contact in some people I had a connection with at some point, and I haven't done the best the job at keeping in touch.  (A tiny part of me also harbors a tiny bit of "huh you didn't bother reaching out to me either," but not so much. I am honestly not too hurt if some didn't reach out, though I guess I am a little bit disappointed at what our relationship had meant).  Soon, I'm going to (re)visit one of the cities where a lot of these friends live, and I'm thinking of reaching out again. But it almost feels as if I'm only reaching out to them now to hang out? after neglecting them the entire pandemic. But it's really not. I don't need somebody to hang out with per se, I just want to see some of these guys again.  So my questions: Are friendships that weren't maintained during the pandemic irrecoverable? Am I overthinking a lot of this? I guess only sensible answer, I'd imagine, is to reach out. If so, what's the best way to go about it? Any advice? Do I need to apologize at all when I do?  Thanks for reading a long post.

Hey pals/fam  I'm 1.5 yrs on E, levels are in "female" range. At about 6 months I felt pretty comfy in how I looked, just wanted bigger boobs and a vagina. As time goes on my facial features are actually giving me more dysphoria. One option is facial surgery to get back to that andro look. I'm also thinking of microdosing E to get back to that happy inbetween, but I know surgeons wont do bottom surgery if youre not on the binary dose of hrt (female range). Does anyone know what the guidelines around this are? I'm not entirely sure who my surgeon will be, either, so that complicated things even more. Haha. In my mind, I could MAYBE evidence that I've lived 1.5 years full time as a binary trans 'woman' with female hormone ranges, and have my psych letters cite this. But just between myself and my GP, microdose?  Thoughts?  Thanks 🥰

U s E l e S s  R a N t  b E L l O w  Losing a job I loved, losing normalcy, and getting used to being on lockdown sucked (for all of us) and now the world is opening up again and we’re supposed to just magically snap out of all the bullshit the covid caused.   Maybe I just need a reason to want to give a fuck again lol. I have Kaya and she helps 🥺  I’m in a pretty sexless relationship with someone who has a very unstable, toxic, dependent relationship with his mother and brother. What I originally saw as someone who cares deeply for his family that depends on him, now I see a man-child making excuses for his toxic, “sick” family. He wakes up in the morning and calls them and I am not a priority. Throughout the day, he just makes excuses for not doing anything he’s said he was going to do a year ago and every day since. And at night I’m not a priority, physically or emotionally or spiritually or sexually or anything.   And to top it off, I don’t seem to do it for him sexually. He doesn’t get hard for me. Like barely half hard. Idk if there is something wrong with me or what :( last night, after being naked and playful with him all day, I begged for sex and he told me he wasn’t even horny and kinda laughed it off. And that was that.  I know that I know what I’m doing..it’s just not working on him. And he gets so uncomfortable when I try to talk to him to see what he needs and wants and to guide him and tell him what I need and want. So we just can’t/ don’t talk about it. Which sucks cause in addition to being a very physical sexual person, I also love the fantasy of it and playing and teasing 🥺  The way he talks to me, part of me thinks he wants me to demean and belittle and dominate him and I JUST CAN’T DO STUFF LIKE THAT. I can’t like be sexually attracted to someone who wants me to make fun of their flaws or their sensitivities or whatever.  I haven’t even made out with someone (my bf) in so so so long which is insane cause I live with my bf lol. I love deep passionate kissing 🥺  Lately I feel like I’m not good enough. I’m not a priority. And I’m starting to feel so lonely again. Not just physically. Emotionally and spiritually lonely.  Idk why I’m even writing all this....I have BPD and I’m having a bad emotional swing, and I probably shouldn’t be here or writing this lmao...just venting since my dog just gives me kisses 🤣

Hello everyone. I am wondering where on the balance sheet I would put the rent that I owe because of the covid lock down. I have not been able to pay the rent due to lack of funds.  What would the classifications be on the balance sheet? MAYBE) liabilities: covid debt? And assets: Right of use?

I'm a 44 year old male.  First dose was fine in the same day, no arm pain.  In the day following we went to a museum and I felt run down.  I went home and laid in bed most of the day tired.  Appetite was a little bit poor, but within a day I was fine.  Second dose I had no reaction whatsoever, even a few weeks out.  Wife is 35, also done with both doses.  Mostly a rundown feeling which was a little worse with the second shot.  Anecdotally a bunch of friends/coworkers got the Pfizer shot - most only had the worn out reaction, which worsened on the second dose.  I was the only one who had no reaction to the second shot.  One friend did get a fever in the middle of the night but was able to work by lunch the next day.  This is probably 15-20 anecdotal stories.  Take it how you will but it's a mixed bunch politically/socially.  Nothing to fear in my opinion but your experience may vary.  Good luck!

 La aparición del «hongo negro» en la India ha sido reportada en medios internacionales. La mucormicosis –u hongo negro– está afectando mayormente a pacientes con covid-19 o que superaron la enfermedad.    Pero, ¿por qué? El Dr. Elmer Huerta lo explica en este episodio.   Hola, soy el Dr. Elmer Huerta y esta es su dosis diaria de información sobre el nuevo coronavirus, información que esperamos sea de utilidad para cuidar de su salud y la de su familia.  Hoy veremos lo que se conoce sobre el «hongo negro» que está afectando a personas con covid-19 en la India.  ### ¿Qué es el «hongo negro»?  [La noticia](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/21/india/black-fungus-mucormycosis-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html) llegó de la India hace algunos días. Miles de personas estaban siendo atacadas por un raro tipo de infección por un hongo -bautizado inmediatamente por la prensa como hongo negro- que causa una severa enfermedad con una alta mortalidad.  [Según las noticias](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/21/india/black-fungus-mucormycosis-covid-explainer-intl-hnk/index.html), miles de personas que estaban sufriendo de un caso activo de covid-19 o que se habían ya recuperado de la infección, estaban cayendo enfermas en la India, infectadas por el «hongo negro».   La mayoría de las víctimas tenían en común ser diabéticas, haber usado altas dosis de corticosteroides durante el manejo de su enfermedad y tener historia de cáncer o trasplante de órganos.  La enfermedad en cuestión se llama mucormicosis, nombre que proviene de las palabras [mucor](https://www.wordsense.eu/mucor/) que en latín significa moho; mico que significa hongo; y osis que significa proceso.

I'm wondering because I just got tickets to game 5 and I noticed something about a vaccination or negative covid test. I'm unsure what that means, do I have to get tested before I go and then show proof?

So I know a lot of us are seeing all these posts about breakthrough cases after being vaccinated. I assume many of you like me have read the studies that say the vaccines are 90+% effective but seeing these posts are jarring. Does anyone have any anecdotal stories of people who have been vaccinated and exposed and did not get covid?

My girl is almost 19 months old, so she was about 4/5 months when we went into full lockdown. We've taken the pandemic very seriously, so she didn't see a single soul aside from myself, my husband and my mom, who comes over a few days a week to babysit while my husband and I work. Otherwise, we did semi-frequent video calls with other family and friends, but that was the extent of her experience with other humans. She became very used to only being in our company because it's really all she's ever known.  Now that my husband and I are both vaccinated, we've started taking her to parks so she can at least see other people and interact with other kids, but we didn't have anyone actually in our home until this weekend when we had 10 (TEN!!!) of our best friends, a 10-month old and two enormous dogs stay over for the long weekend. *\*adults all fully vaccinated, and our ped assured us that it would be low risk for transmission even though the babies aren't vaccinated.*  You guys. This little lady was such a trooper. She basically taught the baby to walk and how to gently pet the dogs, she shared her toys, held his hand like an angel, and modeled how to sit calmly at the table to eat with the grownups instead of throwing food like a banshee.  Her schedule was all screwed up and chaotic...eating at different times, nap at different times, bedtime delayed, so many new people in her space etc etc etc but she amazed me how she just rolled with it. Before the weekend I was so anxious thinking about how she would be miserable with so many changes and strangers around, but she was such a joy and made everyone so happy all weekend with her sweet presence. She smiled, she laughed, she kissed "boo-boos", she showed off all her other tricks, she played by herself and with the baby...  There's no real point to this post, I just want to gush about how proud I am of her. My heart feels like it might burst. She is really coming out of her shell now that we can be around people again. She still doesn't like anyone but us to hold her or touch her, but she is getting much more comfortable interacting with new people.  If anyone else with similar age bubs have concerns about how they will adjust to "normal" life again, maybe this will help you feel more confident in how resilient these little people are.   2020 may have been the absolute pits, but I'm confident that our nuggets will be just fine

My mom just tested positive for COVID-19 (yes, I live with her). I just got a job about 3 days ago and I have the Pfizer vaccine. I also tested negative after she shared the news. My siblings are too young to get the vaccine, though.   What should we do? Should I call out of work? Should my siblings go live with my dad? Let me know if you have any insight on guidelines and procedures.

Hello! I recently applied to get 100 doses of Novavax Vaccines from Unilab. Novavax vaccines will be used for the private sector. I am interested in getting these however I only have around 10 employees here. I will be needing 40 more since you need 2 doses per employee. The ETA will be around Q4 of 2021.

   [PPE](https://preview.redd.it/5u5700su2l271.jpg?width=2250&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e429d1a02fc24c1056cfaa426ddccefb78e6d2e0)  Even though we’ve been dealing with the coronavirus pandemic for nearly a year now, there’s still much we don’t know about this novel illness. As such, many workers are still concerned about performing their jobs efficiently while dealing with the stress that the pandemic is causing all of us. There are many ways that employers can help their workers continue to get the job done while still staying aware of these strange times that we’re living in. In addition to the changes you’ve likely already made, keep these tips in mind as well.  **Adapt, Adapt, Adapt**  Many businesses have already had to adapt immensely as a result of COVID-19. Maybe you’ve had to adjust your business’s hours or move to working from home. Some areas have relaxed their guidelines and restrictions, but you should continue to be flexible as we fight the pandemic.  For instance, perhaps one of your employees is a parent. Their child’s school might have reopened in the fall but is now transitioning to virtual learning from home as the pandemic spikes. Try to adapt as much as possible in these situations, whether that means allowing your employee to work from home (or go back to working from home) or adjust their schedule to allow more time to care for their children. Small adjustments like this can go a long way for the health and stress levels of your employees, and it shows your workers that you care.  **Hear Their Concerns**  On that same note, listen to your workers’ concerns. Make the extra step to ask how they’re doing. Some workers may have adjusted to this “new normal” and are satisfied with the way things are going, while other employees may have some renewed concerns, especially as case numbers rise throughout the holiday season. Simply taking the time to hear what they have to say can provide some stress relief. This is where you can go back to the first tip and see if there are any adjustments you can make to help address your employees’ worries.  **Provide Ample PPE**  One tip that’s a bit more concrete is to make sure you’re providing your employees with ample personal protective equipment, or PPE. Even if your area doesn’t have a mask mandate in place, it’s in everyone’s best interest to wear masks at all times when working with others and socially distance as much as possible. Be sure that your business always has plenty of hand sanitizer, face masks, and gloves on hand, as well as thermometers for temperature checks before your employees’ shifts.  We know that huge quantities of[PPE](https://cetrixstore.com/) probably weren’t in your budget for this year, which is why Cetrix aims to keep prices low with bulk orders. Our PPE offerings are some of the highest quality products on the market and are available at incredible discounts. With features like competitor price matching and recurring monthly order capabilities, Cetrix helps to ensure you’re keeping your workers safe and healthy without breaking the bank.

Hi all,  Sorry for asking if this is obvious. But if you went through the entire process of getting a pu letter and finally got your visa, do you need to be vaccinated to enter China? I am unfamiliar with the green QR health code thing.   What is the latest information on this?  Thank you so much

*NOT antivax or fearmongering*  24f I have been fully vaccinated since February. Recently I’ve had low grade fevers that go away in a day or two without any other symptoms, occasionally a headache. I work with covid patients daily and test frequently and I’ve never been positive. They are getting worse little by little and are very random. Anyone else experiencing this?

I got vaccinated with Covishield in a Community Health Center in Uttar Pradesh recently. The system there was quite open, as in we could see them prepping while we were standing in the queues.   What I noticed and what confused me a little is that while the doctor was tearing open a new syringe for every patient, I could see that she was vaccinating 3-4 people from the same vial of vaccine.  I was under the presumption that one vial would be exclusively used for one person. So is this a dosage thing or is some sort of rationing at play here?   Khattar's recent comment on Kejriwal prompted me to ask this. I honestly don't think that a rationing scheme would've been under the folds for so long now. It would have made news.  Can anybody throw some light?  PS: The vaccine was real. I can tell because I couldn't wake up for 2 days straight. Had a 103.8°F fever at peak.

(Pasted post of what I posted onto r/vaxxhappened considering it will probably get deleted there)      To start off, I am not an anti-science, anti-vax type of person, as I believe that with science, you can do just about anything, if you follow the scientific methods and principles which we have created as a species. However, with the COVID vaccine, this is different. So, I will be supplying a list of reasons as to why I don't believe you should get the COVID vaccine if you are offered to take it, or pressured into taking it from a workplace.  1. Pfizer, Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson, AstraZeneca, and several other vaccine distributors have had issues in the past regarding the legitimacy of their trials, and the safety of their tests. Here is an article from 2014 regarding this - [Big Pharma’s Big Fines (propublica.org)](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/bigpharma#:~:text=Sept%202009%20Pfizer%20was%20fined%20%242.3%20billion%20%2C,United%20States.%20Pfizer%20pled%20guilty%20to%20misbranding%20the) 2. These vaccine were rushed, and do not the approval in which it would have been required in a non-pandemic situation to be released to the public. No COVID vaccine has a full-use FDA approval behind it to back up it's safety and legitimacy, only an "Emergency Use Authorization," meaning that it does not meet the FDA's strong guidelines for safety, and is being used only as a method to calm the public and give a potential solution. 3. Many of these vaccines will have long term effects, and will require annual booster shots to keep their effectiveness up. [Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Updates: Booster Shots, E.U. Supplies (forbes.com)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2021/04/23/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-updates-booster-shots-eu-supplies/?sh=36c74ccdad78) 4. The Virus isn't as deadly as it is made out to be. Many deaths were falsely reported, as the virus has a 99.7% survival rate. 95% of these deaths have comorbities, and the average age of death is the average life expectancy, 78. The vaccine to the virus also has little effect, and this has been said even by health officials, the only effect it has is that you *may* get less sick from the virus if you catch it after being vaccinated.  These are just a few reasons as to why many people are refusing the COVID vaccine, along with me. And to shed some light as to the views and opinions (***cOnSPirAcy ThEoRiEs*** as you like to call them), here is the merit and explanation behind them.  1. Most governments never truly care about the health of their citizens. If they did, insulin, cancer treatments, etc, would be free or very cheap. So some people are a little suspicious when the government is all of a sudden offering them rewards if they go and get a shot. 2. The Government (The US at least) has been trying to infringe on their peoples basic rights, and the media has assisted this by using common, basic fear tactics to help coerce the population along into this. Pressuring people into doing things and giving up their basic rights tends to be frowned upon by a lot of the people who tend to fight for their rights. 3. Masks have little to no effectiveness. Texas for example has been 100% open for weeks now, and never saw the spike in cases that was predicted by many experts and media outlets. Approximately 30% of the nation is vaccinated (Most likely less considering the average political stance on the vaccine in Texas), so assuming best case scenario of 30% vaccination rates in Texas, that does not meet the 70% that experts suggested would be required as a minimum for a herd immunity to take place. 4. Media fear mongering during the entire pandemic. As seen in the graph below, the reported deaths are nowhere as world endingly serious as the media makes them out to be. This is generally seen as fear mongering to most people.  &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/p4ifqku29l271.jpg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae44280e113f3e71a157f2b853eb4d750c9cbb5d  These are just a few of the things that this situation has brought forth. There are many more details and views, some good, some bad. Many of which not many can agree upon, but these are some empirical facts which may hope to shed some lights on some of my views, and others who share my views.

I want to feel loved and wanted. I want to have that romantic experience and for that I'm willing to put it how much ever hardwork/effort it required. I just need to find that one person. I know relationships don't just happen overnight and that it takes time so we could start off slow. We could start off as friends and then if we do end up hitting it of we can take it forward one step at a time and if it doesn't work out well hey at I'll have at least made a new friend.    An overview of what I look like so you have a rough idea of my appearance:  I'm 5 feet tall  I have a slightly dark complexion  I have black curly hair   I have brownish black eyes      What I like doing:  I enjoy stuff that most other people like too  For example  Cooking  Cycling  Going outdoors  Playing games  Watch tv shows movies and anime  Sometimes I also like staying indoors

Hey India, If we have all data: mobile number and related postal code Why cannot we make lottery system to give 2nd vaccination dose by lottery.  What's the point of calling 500 plus people to checkup with 100 doses. If the authorities can distribute vaccine by lottery, this whole tragedy and chance of infection can be avoided...  Incidence happened/happening again n again  In my nearby villages/minor city, they usually provide 150ish doses on every 15 days. People usually queue from early morning, get token by 10.00 and comeback for vaccination if it's in afternoon session.   Yesterday, the token were registered on night right after 12.00 AM and people who came early morning objected, quarrelling. Police also got involved.

Sorry in advance for the long post but I feel like I gotta put it all down  My(currently 19f) junior and senior year of highschool were really rough and I got to the point where I was very depressed and many days felt suicidal. Through this I relied heavily on my bsf as emotional support. I would text her constantly, we'd be over at each others house for a few hours each week... It was really nice. It was a great way for me to be distracted in a safe way.  It's hard to remember the details exactly cuz the memory loss from depression or whatever, but we started getting in small fights. The main one I remember was that one day she was excited about a scholarship she got, and I was trying to be happy and optimistic, but it was really hard for me to be and she was very upset with me about that(as a few times for similar things).  The other big thing was that she and my mom threw me a surprise party for my bday, which would have been amazing, but I had just gotten home from work and the "jump surprise" sent me into a panic attack. Anyways, I said something that upset her in that time, which I apologized for but she couldn't forgive me.  There was another time where we were hanging (multiple times actually) and someone else would call or show up and she would completely ignore me for the rest of the time.  So anyways it piled up and I was upset and tired and I got mad and told her I didn't wanna be friends anymore bc it felt like she was making me feel worse (idk if that's real or I made that up, my brain confuses me) and I, like an idiot, told my friends that we weren't talking anymore but that it wouldn't affect our group.  There were a few more exchanges where I asked what we were bc it felt super awkward when she treated me like a friend but we weren't talking...  So fast forward to now, it's been months since we last talked, almost two years since we ended the friendship... I wanna be friends again. Not necessarily beat friends bc were going to different colleges and so much has happened, but I miss talking to her. It kinda feels like a part of me is missing since we've been besties since elementary school.   I want to text her to apologize and ask to start over or give me a second chance, but I also don't want to be manipulate or toxic friend, so what do you think? Move on finally? Or text her?  Thank you for any Advice:)

I'm "vaccine hesitant" and can't seem to find anyone to discuss the issue with me in a way that is rational, rigorous, non-confrontational, sensitive to the varied and multiple sides of the issue, and open to alternative perspectives. I'd love to find a community in which I can pose some questions and receive assistance in deciding what to do about the vaccine by way of applying our collective critical thinking skills to bear upon the issue.  EDIT: Hi everyone, thanks for your responses. I thought I'd clarify a few things:  1. I'm not looking for a discussion of the vaccine here in this post, just looking for subreddits in which I can discuss the vaccine according to the criteria outlined above. 2. For what it's worth, I'm not antivaxx, and I am politically liberal. 3. I'm not looking for people to confirm my views. Honestly, my views are not yet clear to me on the vaccine. I'm on the fence. Maybe I haven't used the term "vaccine hesitant" correctly yet. I'm looking for rational discussion to help me come to a more clear decision on the vaccine. 4. I understand that consulting Reddit is not the same as consulting a medical professional. In my experience, there are some pretty smart people on Reddit, hence my inquiring here. However, I'm also a bit of a luddite, so please feel free to suggest another online forum that I may not be aware of.  Thanks!  UPDATE: r/NeutralPolitics is exactly the subreddit I was looking for! Thanks again!

It is now 25 days since BMC stopped offering vaccines to 18-44 group in Mumbai (only private hospitals a are offering paid ones) citing lack of stock.  However, BMC magically has stock available to give to 18-44 folks who are fleeing the city to pursue higher education abroad. Yesterday 950 doses were given, today 500 more are planned.  If you're 18-44 year old planning to stay in Mumbai and pay taxes in Mumbai,BMC be like, sucks to be you bro. You're not our priority!  PS: watch all the foreign bound kids come downvote this because they believe they are the most important people and should get highest priority in things.

So I’m due to get my second Moderna vaccine in a few days but I’ve been dealing with cold sores/a sore throat for the past week. It has nothing to do with the initial vaccine cause other (unvaccinated) people in my house are having the same symptoms.  If the symptoms aren’t cleared up by my appointment should I reschedule or just go for it? I haven’t been deathly sick or anything, just a little under the weather, y’know 🤷‍♀️  My info: 20’sF, never had COVID (that I know of), Hashimoto’s disease

**The house is filled with noise, with the sound of rain hitting the window, the TV blasting sports commentary, and *my dads balls slapping against my big fat bubble bottom.* I could barely even breath as I just kept moaning. My dad railing me like an absolute cumslut as I felt my body practically being hammered into the living room old couch. It was all surreal, feeling my old mans hard thick cock pulsing and stretching my hole, his blue balls making my ass red with each slap.**  **I feel my dad slap my ass as his dick begins to tighten, he can feel his ball spunk getting ready to breed his gay ass sons hole, and hes not afraid to let me know. I struggle to keep myself together as I suddenly feel my dad get closer and closer to breeding my tight hole....any second and....**  **“WOOOO TOUCHDOWN MOTHERFUCKER!!”**  **So much for No Nut November...**  ———————————————————————-  Hey there! So Corona has been keeping us all with ourselves lately, and when you’re stuck with the same people everyday, eventually you realize their holes are muuuuch better than your hand.  Roomates turn into fuck buddies, brothers use the youngest as their cock sleeve, and daddies decide that they need to use my hole as their last hope to breed, since mom isn’t home.  Of course maybe my dad resists! Maybe his son keeps flirting with him out of desperation, horniness, or just being a bratty gay motherfucker. Eitherway you know your balls are filled to the fucking brim with ball batter that your wife sadly can’t take right now, and god damn do you need to fucking **breed**.  I have a ton of kinks that can be added to this! Im also willing to make it flexible and make it non-incesty, or do this with a brother/uncle! Its your decision if you want to make the first move, or if you want your slutty ass son to tease you until you just cant fucking take it anymore, you just need to shove that snotnosed brat to the ground and fuck him till he can only say the word daddy!  My kinks include: Incest (doesn’t have to be included ), collars/leashes, degradation, creampies,rimming, rough fucking, breeding talk, wall fucking, riding, brat breaking,knotting, knot fucking large cocks,blowjobs,facials, face fucking,being pinned down, teasing, choking, spanking,name calling,deep throating,pet play, bitting, bdsm,bondage, cumflation, excessive cum, dub con, cock worship and a lot more!  My limits include; Blood, watersports, vore,gore, and scat   Hopefully you guys have gotten to the end and can’t stop your hand from palming your balls at the thought of breeding me! Hope to hear from you studs soon~  (Note: I am looking for really detailed partners, so please no one liners.

Here is an  excerpt from the interview of Swami Aseemanand who was the chief accused in Mecca masjid,Ajmeer blasts and samjhota express bombings .    The hate in hindutva people runs deep,their diabolical misuse of power can be seen here.   Context : He was in Andaman after tsunami doing relief work.    &gt;“Hindu ko dena aur Christian ko nahi dena.” (You should give to Hindus and not to Christians.) Then a Christian woman came for milk for her children. My people said no. She said that the child had not had any food for three days. She pleaded that [the child] would die if we don’t give some milk. So please give some. Then they said, go ask swamiji. I told her that what they are doing is right. You won't get any milk here.

Hey, last couple of weeks I've been reading that people are not coming for the second dose of vaccination and that there is oversupply of the vaccines on vaccination points. So the shots are just laying there.  I have asked in large-scale vaccination center about being a substitute but they told me, they don't do this.   Has any of you been successful in getting the shot as a substitute? How did you do it?

A few days ago, I saw around 40 Rangers personnel enter the Ojha vaccination center through a backdoor. They didn't stand in line when around 300 people were waiting before them, including DOCTORS AND FRAIL, ELDERLY PEOPLE.   Last night, after waiting around 2 hours in line at the Expo vaccination center, as I neared the entry point, I saw two trucks arrive. Navy personnel offloaded and went straight in without waiting in line.  Ye saray mil ker ham ko pagal bana rahay hain.  Edit: not 800 people, but around 300. I wrote 800 mistakenly because my token number was 800.

Hello everyone,  My dad transferred covid to me and to my sister in January 2021. Me, my sister and my dad had the same symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath with exertion, loss of smell. Around February 2021, we all got better and we got a negative PCR result. My family got all their senses back where I still can't smell or taste like normal (either the smell changes or it doesn't smell at all).  Age: 22   Gender: Male.  Thanks in advance.

A year ago, I was very disinclined to take a covid-19 vaccine should one become available. Now, I've had my first dose and I'm planning to get my second.  In this post, I describe how my thinking shifted over the past year. I write this in the hope that it may be useful to other hesitant people, and maybe even to policymakers and communicators.   ## About Me  I'm a young person living in Ontario, Canada, though I think the points in this post are broadly applicable, especially to young people.   ## Part 1: The Hesitancy  I hold one group of people responsible for my hesitancy, and another for helping me overcome it.  I'll call the first group the "establishment". I'm including in it the political establishment (political leaders of most jurisdictions, including mine), the public health establishment (public health authorities of most jurisdictions, including mine), and the media establishment (the majority, though by no means all, of the commentators and experts who appear in mainstream media sources).  In other words, the people who determine the policy responses to the pandemic, and to a large extent the narratives and messaging around it in public discourse.  I've found the prevailing messaging about the pandemic to be very one-sided: all about the risks and dangers of covid-19, and fairly little about the risks and effects of the interventions taken against it.  As a young person, my risk of serious illness or death from covid-19 is very low. Yet, I've been asked to deprive myself of almost all in-person social contact, for (most of) what is now a period of 14 months and counting. Many young people have had their educations interrupted, or replaced with inferior online options. Many others lost their jobs and faced evictions and economic precarity.  And compounding all this was the moralizing attitude that pervaded the establishment narratives. Not only were we asked to cut out in-person social contact, we were asked as if that were _no big deal_. When we failed to completely suppress our fundamental human need for being with other people, we were called "grandma killers", or "the people responsible for dragging this on".  In some circles, if you didn't signal your virtue by emphasizing that every interaction you've had with another person has been virtual, and that you don't even go to the grocery store but get your groceries delivered (never mind that it's a _person_ who has to deliver it to you, doing the rounds in two hundred condo building corridors over the course of her day), you were considered part of the problem.  "Two weeks to flatten the curve", they told us. But the message didn't change from the first two weeks, to the twentieth two weeks.  I didn't feel like what the establishment was asking of me was reasonable and proportionate, and I didn't feel like it was in my best interests.  I _resented_ being asked to make these sacrifices for the benefit of society, and as a result felt resentment and mistrust towards the establishment.  (Perhaps you, the reader, judge me for that. Perhaps you think I'm selfish and should instead meet society's needs with humility and grace rather than resentment. Maybe you're right. But that doesn't change the reality that there are people who think and feel as I do -- perhaps more than you might think -- and getting through to such people requires a change in approach, a change in messaging.)  What does this have to do with vaccine hesitancy? Simply that it was the same establishment -- that I distrusted and resented -- that was now asking me to get vaccinated.  If I felt that _one thing_ the establishment was asking of me (subjecting myself to strict lockdown measures) was not in my best interests, why would I trust that _another thing_ they were asking of me (getting vaccinated) was?   ## Part 2: The Overcoming  Being so disillusioned with mainstream narratives, and feeling like the establishment was not a place for me to look to for sympathy or understanding, I started to look elsewhere.  I found the sympathy and understanding I was looking for from a group of people I started to follow on Twitter. Some of them were doctors (some even epidemiologists), others were lay commentators.  This group of people had a somewhat different perspective on the pandemic. They recognized that the pandemic and the responses to it created a _variety_ of challenges for people: the risk of illness and death from covid-19, but also social isolation, economic hardship, and many others. They showed _empathy_ to people facing any of these challenges.  To borrow a memorable turn of phrase employed by one member of this group, they did not subscribe to the [monomania](https://twitter.com/bergerbell/status/1362527692571119618) that afflicted the establishment, whereby all aspects of how we organize our society revolve around one consideration -- the risk of covid-19 -- to the exclusion of all others.  I want to be very clear: these people were **not** covid denialists or conspiracy theorists of any sort. The doctors among them were respected experts at major universities. They did not dispute the scientific consensus about questions like how covid-19 is transmitted or what its fatality rate is or whether PCR tests work. They just held a minority view about the **policy** aspects of our pandemic response, such as whether extended strict lockdowns were a proportionate intervention, or whether the benefits of school closures outweighed their harms to children.  These folks advocated for a _harm reduction_ approach to covid safety, rather than an _abstinence-only_ approach. They recognized that human beings have needs, and over a period of multiple months, some people _are_ going to meet up from time to time. They never once passed judgment or engaged in moralizing. They gave us the best scientific information available about the risks of various activities -- explaining, for example, how much safer the outdoors was than the indoors, and why -- and left it to us to use that information to make reasoned decisions about our behaviour. They treated us like the human beings possessing agency and autonomy that we are.  In these people, I found something I lacked when listening only to establishment voices. I found a perspective that didn't make me want to tear my hair out. I found values that I could identify with. I found guidance that I felt I could trust.  And now, we come to the crucial part: **this group, too, was enthusiastically pro-vaccine**.  The same message -- "get vaccinated" -- that meant next to nothing coming from the group I resented (the establishment), became trustworthy and valuable advice coming from this group of people I've come to trust.  Rather than sternly warning us that even after vaccination, we'd have to continue to socially distance until some nebulous unspecified time in the future -- which was the main message we heard from the establishment -- this group reassured us that vaccination is our way out of this pandemic, and that it was safe for vaccinated groups of people to do pretty much anything they could do pre-pandemic.  (They also advocated for recognition of this fact by establishment institutions, and were in some cases successful. When, on May 13 2021, the U.S. CDC finally announced that vaccinated people did not, in fact, have to socially distance from each other, that was in part thanks to the efforts of some members of this group to raise awareness about the accumulating evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines at stopping transmission.)  When we had concerns about vaccine side effects, people in this group were generous in taking the time to share their expertise, point us to the latest available accurate information, and help allay our concerns. When reports of rare but serious side effects emerged, such as about the AstraZeneca vaccine causing rare blood clots ("VITT"), they didn't lecture us about how the risk of covid was surely higher. Rather, they recognized that VITT was indeed a scary outcome, and that if we felt more comfortable waiting a few weeks for an mRNA vaccine, that was a perfectly understandable personal choice. (Establishment guidance caught up here too, with AstraZeneca being discontinued for first doses just a few weeks later.)  This group of people helped me get over the fence, from being wholly uncertain that getting a covid-19 vaccine would be in my best interests, to being quite convinced that it was.  I won't list everyone I consider to be in this group, but I'll call out one person who stands out: [Dr. Monica Gandhi](https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9), an infectious diseases doctor at UCSF. I have nothing but admiration and deep gratitude for her. If you want to be part of an online community engaging in empathetic, optimistic, and empowering pandemic discourse, start by following her.   ## Part 3: The Takeaways  Here's my theory for how most people who get entrenched in vaccine hesitancy come to hold their beliefs:    1. Like me (and maybe for similar reasons), they feel disillusioned by the establishment.   2. Like me, they search for other communities and sources of guidance and advice.   3. Rather than encountering the group of people that I did, they encounter a different group -- people who are not only skeptical of the policy responses to the pandemic, but who also question the scientific consensus, and allege conspiracies and cover-ups at various institutional levels.   4. They come to trust this group, because the narratives they offer are more comforting than the ones on offer from the establishment.   5. This group advises them to be skeptical of and reject vaccines (I guess because that fits well with their conspiracy theorizing).  Most current efforts to combat vaccine hesitancy seem to focus on intervening at step (3) of this process -- banning the misinformation purveyors from social media, that sort of thing. We can debate how effective that is likely to be. (I'm personally skeptical that ramping up on censorship would foster trust in the establishment, but that's a topic for another time.)  But what if we intervened at step (1) instead? What if our establishment institutions engaged in the sort of messaging that fosters trust, so people didn't _feel the need_ to look elsehwere in the first place?  I'm not suggesting that authorities simply tell people what they want to hear. (I recognize the dangers of that, as e.g. when some scientists mistakenly claimed early in the pandemic that we were already close to herd immunity. We may have really wanted to believe that, but it wasn't the case.) Accurate, evidence-based information is key.  But there _is_ room to craft guidance and frame discourse in a more balanced, less one-sided way. To replace the shaming and the moralizing with universal compassion and empathy, towards the effects of disease _and_ the effects of interventions. To recognize that after 14 months of isolation, there is a limit to what you can reasonably expect from people, and what tradeoffs people are willing to make for public health. To acknowledge that people desperately need an endgame to this pandemic, to message such an endgame, and to make clear the vital role vaccines play in it.  A few subtle but important changes to our approach could go a long way towards putting a dent in vaccine hesitancy.

# COVID-19 Megathread 62   This is a megathread to consolidate discussion about the COVID-19 outbreak. This thread is a place for discussion, personal anecdotes of providing COVID care, brief updates, and professional questions about the epidemiology and management of COVID-19. Reputable sources (not unverified twitter posts!) are still requested to support any new claims about the outbreak.  We will be hosting a new megathread periodically depending on developments/content. The latest thread will always be stickied and will provide the most up-to-date information. If you just posted something in the previous thread right before it got unstickied and your question wasn't answered/your point wasn't discussed, feel free to repost it in the latest one. If the active COVID megathread isn't stickied, please notify the moderators by [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/medicine) with a link to the thread.  # Background and summary  On December 31st 2019, Chinese authorities reported a cluster of atypical pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. A novel zoonotic virus was suspected and discovered, now named SARS-CoV-2. The syndrome of viral pneumonia caused by this virus -- sometimes associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, anosmia, anorexia, renal failure, and/or gastrointestinal distress -- has been termed COVID-19.  Despite extreme public health interventions at the first epicenter in Hubei province, China, the outbreak has become a global pandemic. Several factors have made for explosive spread of SARS-CoV-2: the human population is immunologically naive, the virus has a long incubation period and can be asymptomatically spread, and is highly infectious, with an rate of transmission significantly higher than epidemic influenza. Unfortunately, COVID-19 has proven deadly as well, with case fatality rate (CFR) estimates ranging between 0.1 to 1% or more. To date, at least 652,000 people have lost their lives in a confirmed case of COVID-19 since December 2019. The true number is suspected to be higher.  The effect of the pandemic on the healthcare system has been extreme, with cases overwhelming normal operations of hospitals during the initial surge in a number of regions, leading to staff exposure, illness, and in some cases, death. This was exacerbated by worldwide shortages in medical equipment, particularly personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers; shortages are still present in many parts of the world including the United States. Rationing of healthcare resources has been widely discussed, and in some areas implemented, creating agonizing decisions for doctors and families.  Healthcare organizations have also been starved of usual revenue, and despite an overwhelming demand for healthcare in some specialties and regions, other medical practices are seeing massive drops in income. Furloughs and pay cuts are becoming common across the American medical landscape. Telehealth visits are becoming common, and practices inside the hospital in many regions have completely transformed. In dense cities that have been handling an onslaught of patients for months, many frontline staff (ER, general medicine, ICU, etc) are physically and emotionally fatigued, yet still face a hazardous working environment.  Although some regions of the United States, Europe and Asia have been able to control the spread of COVID-19 with combinations of business shutdowns, shelter-in-place/quarantine orders, mandatory mask usage, and social distancing protocols, spread has accelerated in other regions of the United States, Brazil, Russia, and India among other areas. Public health interventions remain controversial in many areas, and particularly in the United States, have become politicized and rejected by many.  Medical science has struggled to keep pace with the spread of the virus. Despite a number of hastily executed clinical trials, few agents have been found to have any clinical effect on COVID-19 outcomes. Dexamethasone has emerged as the only treatment so far with a [demonstrated mortality benefit](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news/low-cost-dexamethasone-reduces-death-by-up-to-one-third-in-hospitalised-patients-with-severe-respiratory-complications-of-covid-19) in patients requiring supplemental oxygen or ventilator support. Misinformation and partial information (such as leaks of interim clinical trial data) are rife. Clinical treatment algorithms have swung wildly based on small case series, anecdotes and conjecture, though a shaky consensus for critical supportive care is starting to emerge. Virologists, immunologists, and others have pivoted their usual research and an impressive number of preprints have been generated. However, enormous questions remain, such as the nature of post-infectious immunity.  # Subreddits:  * [r/medicinememorial - memorial pages for health care workers who died in the global fight against COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinememorial/)  * [r/Coronavirus - general news and discussion about the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)  * [r/COVID19 - academic papers and press releases relating to COVID-19](https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19/)  # Tracking/Maps/Modeling:  * [JHU CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)  * [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/ncov)  * [Worldometer case tracker](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/)  * [Coronawiki case tracker](https://www.coronawiki.org/)  * [New York Times case tracker and map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html)  * [BNO News case tracker and map](https://bnonews.com/index.php/2020/04/the-latest-coronavirus-cases/)  * [Wikipedia COVID-19 information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic)  * [CDC death forecasts](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html)  * [IHME projections](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america)  * [University of Texas Modeling Consortium](https://covid-19.tacc.utexas.edu/projections/)  # Resources from Organisational Bodies  * [WHO Daily Sitreps](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports)  * [ECDC Latest](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china)  * [USA CDC Latest](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html)  * [Promed](https://promedmail.org/coronavirus/)  * [Imperial MRC](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/)  * [CDC Info for health professionals](https://bit.ly/2T80VBd)  * [LSHTM](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/research/research-action/covid-19)  * [WHO Technical Guidance](https://bit.ly/2vo9DSM)  * [AMA resource center for health professionals](https://bit.ly/395aNkO)  * [ACP Information for Internists](https://bit.ly/2T99Rqc)  * [CDC Pandemic Preparedness Resources](https://bit.ly/2whQmCU)  * [UpToDate COVID-19](https://bit.ly/2Tphyam)  * [EMCrit](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/COVID19/)  * [SCCM](https://www.sccm.org/covid19)  * [RCoA/ICS](https://icmanaesthesiacovid-19.org/)  * [Intensive Blog](https://intensiveblog.com/covid-19/)  * [NICE Guidance](https://www.nice.org.uk/covid-19)  * [ICU Net](https://covid19-icu.net/)  * [EMRAP](https://www.emrap.org/corependium/chapter/rec906m1mD6SRH9np/Novel-Coronavirus-2019-COVID-19?SearchType=%22text%22)  # Reminders  This subreddit is heavily moderated and comments may be removed without warning.

No i am not a nazi qanon trumpie just cuz i wont get a vaccine for a virus that has a 99% survival rate and killed a 1000 times less then the death toll claims. Its bad when there offering money to try to get you to take the vaccine also very sus that bill gates is pushing the vaccine so hard but refuses to get it himself and told his kids not to get it either. For those who got the vaccine stick a magnet to your injection site and see the magic yourself. I just walk around the store without a mask now and just say i am vaccinated so i dont have to wear a mask that does nothing to help me or others around me. If you ask me the Left has a mask fetish wanting people to wear masks so much.

This weekend my restaurant dropped the mask requirement for fully vaccinated servers two weeks after the final shot.   Vaccinated guests are also allowed to be maskless.   My area has been super diligent about masks and distancing for the entire pandemic. In fact, we just recently opened indoor beyond 25% capacity.   I’d say most guests are still wearing a mask everywhere except while at the table. Maybe 10% of the restaurant staff has started working maskless.   What would y’all do as a vaccinated server? Continues masking or go free…?  Also don’t want to jeopardize loosing any tables which in turn equals $$$  What are your restaurants doing?

Some facts: 1. With the new rank system, you require just four wins to get all the way from rank 1 to 11. 2. You can only gain one rank per set, which means you need to play ten sets to rank 11. 3. It is detrimental to win more matches than is strictly necessary to rank up in each set (for a number of reasons which I can explain if needed).  This means that, currently, the OPTIMAL way to play GBL, is to aim for 4 wins in your first 50 matches, a win ratio of less than 10%. Winning more will result in far less stardust and rare candy for you in the long run. This has resulted in an absolute tank-fest at the lower ranks amongst players who have realised this.  I myself went in to day 1 aiming to lose 25/25 matches (as it is optimal) by leaving every single match instantly. I won 8 out of 25 just by the opponent beating me to the "leave match" button. There were also a LOT of games where the opponent was not attacking (and I'm sure trying to leave) but I thankfully won the "race". I estimate well over half of my games were against opponents who were literally racing me to press "leave match". This is not good game design.  This was already a problem in previous seasons but the lower rank up requirements to 11 has really exacerbated it this season. Niantic need to rethink the whole rank / reward system because the play style encouraged by the current one is ridiculous, really.  And yes, I know you have the option to play every game properly. But all you are doing is screwing yourself out of a lot of star dust and rare candy. It really should not be a choice between "trying to win" and "getting rewards", it's completely counter-intuitive.  As for a solution, the only thing I can think of is to make stardust rewards even across all ranks AND make the reward tracks cumulative across all games, not per set (i.e. whether you go 1-4 five times or 5-0 once and 0-5 four times, you would receive the same rewards). Anything less than both of these changes together would mean hard tanking the start of every season would still be optimal.

Hej alle sammen!  Jeg ville høre om der var kvinder her på subben, som var blevet vaccineret med enten AstraZeneca eller Johnson &amp; Johnson?   Jeg er selv en kvinde, og nu hvor vaccineplanerne bliver ved med at blive skubbet, er jeg kraftigt begyndt at overveje det selv, selvom jeg stadig er bekymret for diverse bivirkninger. Jeg kender ikke selv kvinder som er blevet vaccineret med den, så derfor tænkte jeg at jeg lige ville høre om der var nogen her på subben.  Jeg kender godt til de generelle bivirkninger, men er interesseret i at høre hvilke bivirkninger I har oplevet efter at være blevet vaccineret med AstraZeneca eller Johnson &amp; Johnson. Jeg vil også rigtig gerne høre lidt om hvad lægen sagde til videokonsultationen, og om I generelt har haft nogle sundhedsmæssige overvejelser ved at melde jer.   Jeg håber at I har lyst til at dele jeres  erfaringer med mig! :)  God dag!

Hi, so for the last 8 weeks I've been tapering from 150mg Sertraline and 175mg Quetiapine. I've made it down to 25mg Sertraline and 25mg Quetiapine. All of my reductions have been minor and only done when I felt my body was ready, initially, the withdrawal symptoms were debilitating, I'm guessing because I've been on these for 2 years and it shocked my body.   Anyway, I'm feeling fine now and my depression, anxiety and other multitude of things have been stable - I've been relatively happy.   I've seen that a lot of people alternate days when they get to 25-50mg (Sertraline, I'm not sure for Quetipine as I can't find much on it) and that seems to increase withdrawal symptoms and sometimes mental health issues because it lowers in the blood concentration (gets to it's 26 hour half-life) and then it spikes again...   My question is, is it okay to just quit from 25mg of each medication? I know people do quit cold turkey but that worries me a lot. What are peoples experiences?   Also FYI, I know it's not recommended to taper off 2 medications at the same time, but I'm fine (who knows about future brain damage but here we are).

I know being contaminated makes you cough so itd counter iron will (i think) but other then that whats the point. All it seems to affect is that zombies and the tentacle will always damage you. Why cure your self and have a limited number of vaccines when theres no real point to curing yourself anyway. You can just infect yourself with a zombie and cuck the killer of the mutation juice. Itd be cool if nemi still mutated a bit if a survivor infected themselves on a zombie to negate this but yeah.

So I was finally able to get vaccinated in my country for my age group 26 (m)   Seeing how it's been 6 months since I had it and immunity about generally speaking is up for debate but the general consensus is that it can last at the shortest 90 days and at the longest 6-8 months? 1 year?   Hard to say right now and people have gotten it twice .    I got my first pfizer shot on Friday night.  I noticed some injection site pain( arm) along with some slight neck pain but nothing too bad.  Woke up on Saturday and I felt super sick.  I had chills, body aches ( mainly back, knee joint pain when bending down ) which was expected   But the I started having a familiar feeling that I had 2 or 3 weeks after I recovered from covid.  Costochrondritos (chest wall inflammation)   I had a feeling it was because whenever I would take a deep breath I would get pain in my lower back, rib and only chest pain on the left side. Also had some leg pain almost felt like nerve pain I'm not too sure but it was noticeable.  Also my injection site arm was super sore like I couldn't move my arm very much and it was super swollen.   I also noticed my heartrate was elevated around 98 although tp be honest this could be from anxiety around my symptoms I was having but I think its gone back down to 65-70 resting as of Monday the 31st.  I took it easy had some Tylenol, water Gatorade and didn't do too much that day.  Sunday I felt alot better so I guess I decided it was a good idea to go play golf (local par 3 course near my house since it was nice out)   My arm wasn't really sore anymore I had some joint pain but not much and my chills were gone so I thought it would be a good idea (it probably wasn't lol)   I also didn't sleep well 3 hours I'm guessing mainly due to anxiety around my symptoms and stress in general.  So I woke up to go to work on Monday had some water,  Tylenol.  I obviously felt fatigued most likely due to the lack of sleep and I got my morning coffee.   For the majority of today I had some pretty bad nausea after my coffee which is unusual for me and I had to go poop twice within an hour not quite diarrhea though.  I had some more body aches (mild)   And the nausea didn't subside until I had dinner I felt better after that.  So this is where I'm at right now I am speaking with my doctor tomorrow morning at 10 am to see what she has to say.  I have read that this isn't completely unheard unheard or uncommon with  people who have had covid and gotten vaccinated.  Makes me worried about the 2nd dose in 6- 8 weeks as supposly it can be worse symptom wise.

Hello everyone, wanted to share my recent not so pleasant experience.   I was diagnosed with RA 3 months back  and I was put on HCQ medication. About 3 weeks ago I got the Astrazeneca Covid vaccine and about 5 days back I started noticing a rash on the left side of my abdomen. Turns out it is herpes zoster and the doctor told me that she has had about 5 patients with herpes zoster after covid vaccine. Especially if you are on immunosuppressants.   This is just my personal experience and not a statement about the vaccine. Take care.

I had a day off MD yesterday and today I had the second dose of astrazeneca vaccine. The first one made me tired and have headache for weeks. I'm quite positive, that the second one will not have that big of an impact. Now I'm wondering if I still could do some LSD or shrooms today. Especially cause I got up at 5am to be at the vaccine center at 8am. Now I'm thinking if I can take like 10mcg or a few crumbs of shrooms. 😂 What do you think? Anyone experience with this?

I've read in statistics that vaccine efficacy rate for Pfizer for example is around 90% or so.  Does that mean 9 in 10 people will be able to live fine and come in contact with virus while 1 in 10 on average will get infected eventually  OR  Does it mean that each vaccinated person will be safe in 9 in 10 cases when encountering the virus and will eventually get it on 10th encounter (on average)?  I am fully vaccinated, taking vit D, being healthy, eating right, exercising, yet still very fearful of real life interactions. On the other hand it's been like 1.5 years of isolation and I finally want to meet people.  Not sure how to go around this.

Title mostly sums it up. I’ve been fortunate enough to have a job that allows me to WFH until the pandemic rides out. While I’ve never been a huge makeup person, I’ve been consistent in wearing some amount most days. I’m a lawyer and, while not at a firm anymore, I feel it is pretty much expected.  Working from home had its hurdles but I do not miss the time or money spent on makeup. I do like having it on sometimes but, in a way, wearing it on and off seems more likely to emphasize the “off” days.  I don’t think anyone would intentionally think lesser or hold it against me if I stepped away from the stuff most days of the week but I do think people would notice and the association would be negative.  Anyone else? What’s your approach?

Trip report of my first ever trip. It all started off with me getting interested in psychedelics at the age of 16,  never having done anything, not even alcohol or weed. I simply didn't have interest in those things. I actually did a pretty good amount of research before my trip, around 6 months after really wanting to try acid, i got what I wanted.   Tested it, found out that a good dose for a first trip would be at around 100ug, i choose a Sunday night, didn't ate anything 6 hours before the experience, swallowed the supposedly (will get later onto this) 100ug at around 10 pm and this is where it all really starts.   Watched the first part of rush hour (really good movie btw) and felt the first effects after like 30 minutes. Just felt really awake, everything was funny and I was kinda shivering and cold and very excited.  45 minutes after dropping i noticed the first visuals. As the camera in the movie was moving, the eyes of Jackie Chan got HUUGE. I was so happy lol. At the end of the movie I looked at my wall and it was covered with beautiful patterns wich transformed into elephants with crowns and those indian ornaments. It was amazing.   I got up to the toilet after starring at my wall for wich felt like hours, but as I saw on my phone it was only 12 pm.  As I got up, everything looked really symmetrical and moved around.  The way through the living room and the kitchen felt soo long. After finally arriving, i looked in the bathroom mirror and saw my face morphing like crazy, I saw myself growing a fractal beard and my eyes were growing and shrinking.   Got back to my room and watched a nature video with beautiful landscapes and it looked beautiful. Full of colorful fractals, eyes and indescribable, beautiful complex geometric patterns. So I decided to go to my window and to look outside (note: it was around 12:30 at that time so it was really dark outside) i pulled away my curtains and behind me was this mainly orange, fractal creature wich i precieved as a evil witch just standing there with an evil grin on its face.   I was scared. I closed my curtains immediately and jumped to my bed asap.  I didn't expect 100ug to be that intense but I remembered that if you fight the experience that it will go south.  So I listened to some music, turned off the lights and closed my eyes. It was amazing (Texted my gf about how amazing it was and she called me via video call and I couldn't close the call because the little red button was dodging my finger).  At first I was seeing fractal tunnels covered with the hyena from the movie the lion king just opening and closing its mouth, then turning sideways so that i just saw the eye, which transformed into complex fractal geometric patterns.  suddenly i heard this loud electric whir and opened my eyes.   In the dark i could see what I precieved as a demon, made out of tracers (it looked really similar to the animation of the predator from the movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger when it was invisible, just it was constantly changing it's shape) flying towards me, turning into this blade made out of tracers and suddenly, right before it was going to pierce me, it disappeared.  I thought to myself that this is to intense for 100ug, followed by me not remembering that i even took anything.   I was freaking out but remembered that if you fight the experience that it will just get worse.  I remembered that what I was expecting is called ego Death, so I somehow still managed to open your video called live ego Death (around 1:30 am) and closed my eyes from relief. From this moment on i don't really remember anything other than sometimes getting aware of myself for a few seconds and  getting overwhelmed by the visuals and the feelings, followed by completely forgetting everything.     Then at around 3:30 pm i was coming back from the peak and got stuck in a loop, eating oranges wich i prepared at the beginning (noticed that fruit is just amazing while tripping) and watching the video of you wich i opened beforehand. After 30 minutes of looping (i was thinking "why am I like this, am i crazy? No i just took acid. You can get crazy from taking acid, but if you know that you are crazy, are you really crazy?" Just repeating over and over again), after that i wanted to play league of legends.     It took me forever to start a match because I thought that everything written there had a deep profound message. After finally being able to start it, i couldn't play it because I didn't want to defeat anybody because I was them and it didn't made sense to me why you would like to defeat yourself.     After that i was again up to the toilet ( just got up drinking water and going to the toilet pretty often because I couldn't feel if I was thirsty or had to pee and thought I was going to die from dehydration or kidney failure, simply because I couldn't notice it) but my mom was in the kitchen getting ready for work (it was around 5:30 am at this time) and I was convinced that she knew that i was on acid, so i didn't even bother to act normal wich kinda saved me i think, because looking back i was actually acting more calm because of this).   Luckily she didn't start a conversation and I just said goodbye to her so she didn't notice it at the end. My voice sounded really distorted and echo like to me so I thought I sounded really weird, what just added to my thinking that she knew. So the rest of the trip, i was watching doctor strange and slept at around 9am, still seeing some minor visual distortions.   Later I found out that the tab I took was a hotspot, simply by later trips, every 100ug trip after that was not even half as intense, so I think it was around 250-275 ug, because I've experienced trips in that dose range which were very similar in intensity, but i guess I will never know the dose for sure.   Looking back it was simply to intense for a first trip, but I would never change it if I could.   It was very profound but after an experience this intense i didn't drop acid for 6 months. Also I was really young at this point but as prepared as I could be, but I don't think that you can ever be ready to have such an experience. It's just beyond words and understanding.   I hope you enjoyed my trip report and will review it in one of your future videos. Bye!

I just don't know what to do anymore. We lived together. I saw him and talked to him everyday. He was such an unbelievably pure human being. He had so much love and concern for my sister and I. I loved hearing his voice, his laughs, everything. I don't have any parents anymore. I honestly would be happy to die of a heart attack in my sleep tonight... I just can't take this anymore. There's nothing for me in this life anymore, honest to God. This life is just anxiety and dread and despair.

https://scryfall.com/@Dominarkis/decks/56234efb-53e7-4340-b92f-50bcb6c44560  So I played a very different prototype a ton at modern events at my lgs, but since that was shut down I've essentially just been tinkering with it unchecked and I think I need a sanity check on the deck. Does it make any sense? What should I change. Any advice appreciated!  I should mention that the 60th card is the red card in the mh2 evoke cycle, it's just not on scryfall yet

I registered to get myself vaccinated today in the morning from 9-11 am slot and after waiting at the centre for an hour the doctor came outside and told everyone to download their slip again. I did that and turns out it got rescheduled from 1 June 2021 to 1 March 2022. The suspicious thing is, I registered when the price was Rs 250 for the dose and now it's at Rs 900 at the same centre. Almost everyone's registration got rescheduled there.

So i was hospitalised for around 10 days bcz of covid and couldnt bath the whole time! I am surprised how i havent had a single bump in my armpits, near my breasts or under my abdomen since. I did tho have an open wound near my thigh which i think happened because of my underwear. Its open and yet doesnt pain at all. I didnt even notice it until i saw it.  Can this be because of covid medications maybe? I have been on antibiotics for like 20 days now. Also taking doxy 2 times a day. And doxy helps reduce my bumps like shit.   God, i dont want to go back to flaring up. Before covid i gained like 20 kgs and started flaring up in all these new places like crazy. 4-5 bumps bursting open a week.. but now i lost around 8 kgs and also the bumps are gone.  How do i maintain this?  Keeping my weight down is one thing i can think of. I really dont want to go back to old ways.  Anyone else had the same experience? Did your bumps come back?

Should I lower my test while I’m cutting, or try and grow while getting leaner. I went from 179 to 197 in 8 weeks, but I started this already at 15% bodyfat which was dumb.   Should I lower the dose just to retain muscle while I cut for 8 weeks?

Hi,  I'm fed up this green abomination but not having strength to quit CT like I did before from 9gpd, now being at 15 - 20+ gpd (1,5 years clean, then wanted to try to take occasionally like responsible adult - you know, story old as Abraham).  Have anyone of you succeed to kick k by stretching the dose take as far as RLS appears and then take like 3 g or less?  And that way take less and less per day until it's done/jump is tolerable.  Edit: Something keeps downvoting these posts. If it's not bot activity, please share your critical opinions also! :)

We met on tinder about a few months in to quarantine and we were flirting for almost a year. We really got to know each other and I made it clear I was interested in her. She was too and we agreed to meet up around summer time when coronavirus vaccines were coming:.   Over a few months ago I started feeling anxiety cause of social distancing and I expressed occasionally I felt anxious if she wanted to even meet after quarantine. Last month or so We were just chatting and she said she was hanging out with some guy , I asked her if they were involved and she said yea and I asked again if it meant she wasn’t single, she said yea. (Paraphrasing). I ghosted her and blocked her after wishing her well. I was sad for a week or so.  I was going through a few old messages cleaning my phone and it turned out she sent me a message right after I unfriended her saying it was a joke and she asked if I was being serious. I added her back and she wasn’t very happy. She said she was sad for a week after I unfriended her and she even tried to reach out through other social media but I had blocked her. I was following the nocontact rules from Reddit that you’re supposed to do when you feel devestated  She said she felt lonely cause I was the only person she talked to everyday and I said it was for my emotional care, and that t was a misunderstanding and if she still wanted to talk.  She said she’ll think about it and left me on read  So I was I even in the wrong. If so, how do I get her back on good terms with me. Just wait and hope she replies? Or make a bigger effort. Or was she totally in the wrong for playing that joke when I wasn’t in a good headspace at the time and I should just forget about her

Hey everyone!  Lately, I was thinking about something. How hijabs sometimes look really hot and slutty. It's exactly like all the nun things we can see on some websites, and today, I want to have a piece of that too.  You can play as a woman or transwoman, don't worry about that, even sissies might do.  You can be my new step daughter, a neighbor, a student I have or even my new stepmom! I want everything to be consensual, so nothing forced or noncon, it's a huge turn off.  As for my kinks, I love rough sex, ap, taboo, age gaps, passionate sex, feet, anal, slutty partners, outfit play, dressed sex, domination, public...  My limits are only snuff, gore, toilet and vore.  Interested? Send me a pm with your kinks and who you will play ;)  I am 18+ and all characters and participants must be 18+

i’ve had experience with dxm taking anywhere from 200- ~700mg, but only 1 experience with dph, that being a suicide attempt. idk how much it was it was just a large handful. you might be able to tell from the symptoms i had; i woke up having my hand phase through objects and thought i was a ghost, then went to work around 12 hr later, thought people were saying things completely different than what they really were, and also thought i ran over a baby with a shopping cart and heard it’s cries. i heard that whatever plateau dph trip u want u should replace half of it with dxm. i was originally thinking 300mg dxm and 250 dph. lmk if i should go any lower thnx.

*01 June 2021*  The WA Health Department has reported a case of hotel-quarantine acquired COVID-19 today, following confirmation of genome sequencing data.  The Department can confirm the virus was transmitted in hotel quarantine at the Pan Pacific Perth Hotel, as two guests, in rooms next to each other, had the same sequence of virus.  The person to whom the virus was transmitted was previously reported as Case 1018.  The cause of transmission is not yet known and is subject to further investigations. The Pan Pacific Perth Hotel has previously advised WA Health that its rooms are negative pressure.  The Public Health team has taken immediate action to ensure that the transmission has not spread further at the hotel.   This includes additional precautionary testing of guests and reviewing testing results of security guards who worked on the floor since the date of infection.  The 12 people in the rooms on the same floor but not near Case 1017 are all asymptomatic and were negative on Day 13. All have now left the quarantine facility and will be tested 3 and 7 days after leaving. Public Health is in daily contact with these guests.  WA Chief Health Officer Dr Andrew Robertson said there is no public health benefit in testing them earlier than planned.  “A further three people (family) who were in a room opposite Case 1018 are asymptomatic and have tested negative. They remain in quarantine and have been moved to an alternate room. They will be retested at Day 17 and Day 21,” he said.  “We are still exploring the best options for their management.”  The State Health Incident Coordination Centre (SHICC) has been proactively developing and implementing protocols for guest room allocations to limit the risk of transmission to guests, hotel quarantine workers and ultimately, the community.  Public Health has confirmed that all security guards who worked on the floor since the date of infection have tested negative in the last four days and continue to follow the daily testing schedule, noting they are all vaccinated.  Staff continue to undergo an oral swab daily and must undertake a nasopharyngeal PCR test every seven days.  All Quarantine Centre workers are required to wear level 2 surgical masks and protective eyewear, at all times in high risk areas (any place guests are accommodated or when guests enter/exit hotels) and are vaccinated.  **ENDS**  Source: [https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2021/COVID-19-update-1-June-2021-hotel-acquired-case-confirmed](https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2021/COVID-19-update-1-June-2021-hotel-acquired-case-confirmed)

Hello, did anyone feel long term effects after receiving their second shot? I received my second shot on Saturday morning and it's  now Tuesday, it's been 3 days and I still  feel like shit, I feel very tired, sleeping all day and light-headed,  I cannot concentrate and I  had to cancel some online meetings I had today. Did anyone feel the same ? And if so, how long did it last? I know everyone's body is different but it'd be nice to have some feedback from those who got symptoms that lasted more than 2 days.  Edit: I got my thyroid removed 6 years ago and I take thyroid medication.

Hi All, hope everyone is coping well despite the ongoing pandemic (I hope it is ok to post this here - happy for it to be removed if not). I am a member of a large international survey project looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the entire population of countries, including people in Wales (and Caerphilly!). The project involves almost 200 investigators in more than 35 countries and has been endorsed by multiple national and international professional organizations and ethical approval has also been obtained from the University of Southampton (for the UK side of the project) and from Aberystwyth University (for the Welsh side of the project specifically). The COH-FIT project aims to identify risk and protective factors that will inform prevention and intervention programs for the COVID-19 pandemic and should other pandemics occur in the future. We are hoping if anyone is kind enough to spend just about 30mins on this survey - we will be so grateful to you. The findings will be of huge importance in improving our understanding of the impact of the pandemic and how to cope with it.

Hi, I saw this news about a woman in England that die after take AstraZeneca. I read on the sun is a news from 04/26/21  I'm from Brazil and in here we are not having other options... they by in the Pfizer one and ends very fast... My day of vaccination already pass and since my neurologist said is better don't take AstraZeneca. I don't get vaccinated.  My mom got vaccinated if Astrazenica she is a nurse. In the time we don't had any type of news here that this vaccine is making people sick...  Anyone in here have some opinion about?

So me and my friends were always interested in D&amp;D but we knew no one that could teach us, no idea where/how to start. Finally, a friend a myself got enough of "waiting for the right moment/a way in" and decided to take the matter in our own hands. We told our friends that at that date, that time (in a month and a half), we're having a D&amp;D game. They were all aboard, and so enthusiastic.    The two of us got the PHB, DMG, and a starter kit, and now we're trying to setup everyone with their characters. As I said, I haven't dropped the PHB for anything else than eating and working. Reading all about this universe and trying to setup a group gave me a sense of purpose I haven't had in a long time.  We're trying to stick to the PHB for the most part, but we didn't want to prevent our friends of having fun by forbidding something they really wanted to do, so we've got a Kenku and a Warforged in our party of 6.  So far we only have race/class/background (except me, my character sheet is almost done) for everyone, it's hards to learn all rules of each race/class/background involved in the PHB and making sure everyone understands.  I've got a few questions still... So far we've got a fighter, two rogues, a barbarian, a sorcerer and a ranger (me). I'm a bit worried by the melee/physical/damage heavy party. I plan to use my ranger as a healer/bowman with proficiency in medicine and healing spells at level 2, but I fear it might not be enough. And we've got only a single spellcaster, I'm not worried about the low-level creatures, often just simple beasts, but at some point wouldn't the lack of magic start to be noticeably inconvenient?  I'm really looking forward starting this adventure.

Like in the title, please remember to cancel or reschedule your appointment in the system if you can't make it or you already had your vaccine dose (walk in earlier). I have volunteered yesterday in one of the centres and we had around 800 appointments but most of the people didn't turn up and we just mostly sat idle through the day. I assume that some people from the list did the walk in when the guidelines changed (gap from 10-12 weeks to 8 weeks) and forgot to cancel the appointment. Unfortunately data cannot automatically be populated between two systems - online booking and NHS due to data protection.   Thanks!

I’m just now watching Darcey and Stacy, and I am BLOWN AWAY that Darcey left her daughters “for a couple months” to quarantine in a studio apartment with a man she’s met twice. Am I alone in this feeling? I’m like angry! Lol  She’s a mother, and during the most uncertain, scary time in memory, she thought it was more important to be with a man than to be with her young teen daughters? That’s how fucking desperate and pathetic she is? She’s truly demented. Life changed so much for those girls and then their selfish, irresponsible, thirsty AF mom moves out with a stranger. SHE IS UNWELL. I pray this is all fake and staged for TLC otherwise, someone needs to come take care of those girls.   I know they are with their grandpa, but I cannot imagine my mom choosing a man over her kids during a GLOBAL PANDEMIC. It’s blowing my mind how selfish and pathetic this woman truly is.   Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;  [ 加拿大联邦外长加尔诺（Marc Garneau）。（Adrian Wyld／加通社）  ](https://preview.redd.it/u5mhcn8fmm271.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bac8c542fbc3c31bba136ab693918b614ff5a70d)  加拿大外交部长加诺（Marc Garneau）表示，加拿大支持美国总统拜登采取行动，即命令美国情报机构进一步调查COVID-19的起源。  据CTV News周日报导，加诺说，由于世界卫生组织（WHO）之前发布的关于该病毒如何首次传播给人类的报告，其实在很大程度上尚无定论。因此，需要更深入的调查。  他说：“重要的是，我们要科学地弄清它的起源，因为它可能再次发生。因此，我们支持拜登总统本周早些时候宣布的决定，要进行更全面的调查。”  美国政府上周四宣布，他们将与其它国家一起，在全球范围内唿吁中国，在确定病毒爆发如何开始方面，表现得更灵活一些。而且，不排除病毒起源于中国实验室的可能性。  拜登要求美国情报机构在90天内提交调查报告，并称他打算公开该调查的结果。拜登指示美国国家实验室协助调查，并指示情报部门为中国政府准备一份具体的查询清单。  世卫组织和中国专家今年3月份发表了第一份报告，提出了关于COVID-19大流行如何产生的4个假设，包括假设最可能的情况是病毒通过中介动物、从蝙蝠传给了人，以及从实验室爆发的可能性极低。  世卫组织总干事谭德塞当时很清楚地强调，该报告只是更广泛调查的开始，而不是结束。  加拿大安全情报局（CSIS）前局长、曾任总理特鲁多和哈珀国家安全顾问的法登（Richard Fadden）表示，如果中共政府不合作的话，由美国领导的调查也不太可能产生更清晰的结果。但此举还是有意义的。  “中国将不会比以前更加合作，让我们发现到底发生了什么。”法登说，他认为拜登这样做，是在发出一个信号，就是美国不会就此罢休。  &amp;#x200B;  大纪元  2021-06-01周行多伦多

I could write a whole diatribe on why I feel this way.  However, I’ll keep it to the major point. This is supposed to be the social period of kids lives and they don’t really have that anymore.  A lot of kids are having to learn to use technology that half of them can’t even really comprehend yet because they can’t spell.   Teachers are worked dry so they can’t really focus on individual students anymore.  It’s just, the pandemic hit me hard, really hard. However, I’ve never seen my own niece break down so much about school in her life. She’s had almost five or six breakdowns and she’s only ten.  It’s not to say that adults don’t have it hard. However, as an adult I can recognize when someone has it harder than me, even if they are that young.  Edit: I do understand a lot of people will feel differently than I do, and that is okay. The pandemic hit a lot of people hard. This is simply my own perspective from my own environment.   I am not here to invalidate how you feel about the situation, simply to start a discussion.

This weekend or so I was gonna get the vaccine but then I got on TikTok and this lady was talking about how the vaccine is messing with some periods because of hormones and stuff. Hundreds of other women were talking around how it caused them extreme pain or it made their period better in the comment section. I can feel my period coming because I’m getting cramps (I’m 7 days late lol) but I’ll get the vaccine after my period is over so I have time to brace myself.   I just don’t wanna get the vaccine now because I’m not tryna play Russian roulette with period cramps especially when I’m about to go a few places next week. I don’t wanna ruin the trip for my friends because I’m puking and bleeding all over the place. I’ll keep my mask on at all times tho. I had COVID once and I’m not tryna get it again.   Also I might be going swimming soon, how can I ask my mom for tampons/ a cup? She’s one of those “your a virgin” and “your too small for one” type person.

(I'm a bot) ***** &gt; China has reacted harshly to Japan&amp;#039;s proposal to offer coronavirus vaccines to Taiwan, saying vaccine assistance should not be a political tool.  &gt; Japan&amp;#039;s Foreign Minister Motegi Toshimitsu said last Friday that the government is considering providing its extra supply of coronavirus vaccines to other countries and regions, including Taiwan.  &gt; China&amp;#039;s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a news conference on Monday that Japan cannot even guarantee its own people enough vaccines at the moment.  &gt; Wang said vaccine assistance should return to its original purpose of saving lives, and not be reduced to a tool for political self-interest.  &gt; In response to Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen&amp;#039;s accusation that China had blocked Taiwan&amp;#039;s deal with a foreign vaccine maker, Wang said Beijing has made utmost efforts to help Taiwan.  &gt; He went on to say that Taiwan&amp;#039;s ruling Democratic Progressive Party was discouraging the distribution of vaccines made in China.   ***** [**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210531_34/) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ "531729 summaries so far.") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **vaccine**^#1 **Taiwan**^#2 **China**^#3 **Wang**^#4 **Foreign**^#5  Post found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/npq5dq/china_condemns_japan_offering_vaccine_to_taiwan/).  *NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-to-use-greek-alphabet-for-covid-19-variants/) reduced by 58%. (I'm a bot) ***** &gt; GENEVA - The World Health Organization announced Tuesday a new nomenclature for the COVID-19 variants that were previously - and somewhat uncomfortably - known either by their technical letter-number codes or by the countries in which they first appeared.  &gt; Hoping to strike a fair and more comprehensible balance, WHO said it will now refer to the most worrisome variants - known as &amp;quot;Variants of concern&amp;quot; - by letters in the Greek alphabet.  &gt; &amp;quot;They will not replace existing scientific names, but are aimed to help in public discussion,&amp;quot; said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO&amp;#039;s COVID-19 technical lead. The new system applies to variants of concern - the most troubling of which four are in circulation - and the second-level variants of interest being tracked.  &gt; Future variants that rise to &amp;quot;Of concern&amp;quot; status will be labeled with subsequent letters in the Greek alphabet.  &gt; WHO said a group of experts came up with the new system, which will not replace scientific naming systems but will offer &amp;quot;Simple, easy to say and remember labels&amp;quot; for variants.  &gt; The WHO has been trying to come up with simplified new nomenclature for the variants for several months.   ***** [**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-to-use-greek-alphabet-for-covid-19-variants/) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ "531730 summaries so far.") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **variant**^#1 **new**^#2 **COVID-19**^#3 **known**^#4 **concern**^#5  Post found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/nppryx/who_to_use_greek_alphabet_for_covid19_variants/).  *NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.

So I read a nice little overview of potentiating drugs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/hk0yiv/the_ultimate_drug_potentiation_guide_updated/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share).   And I have been taking Agmatine 2g per day, with r-ala   100mg / 300mg.g NAC. What I noticed is that my tolerance to dose has increased significantly. I am also on a low dose of SSRI and it seems like ever since I started the sort of overstimulation effects have been more prominent: anxiety, stares into empty space and a sense of dread since starting and on occassion combining them.  Now lately I've started supplementing with the ones I mentioned.. but instead of having a increase in euphoria it seems to have been blunted.. or the quality of my amphetamine has been real shoddy.  Now the post says (dose low on the agmatine; higher dose might dull euphoria)  So if I'm reading this right my 2g daily dose is fylling my enjoyment of the Adderall, my NAC dose does the same and the r-ala means I won't feel high at all from simply counteracting changes in behaviour and preventing mania (witch I suppose is the word for awesomeness)  I get it r-ala really turned the SSRI and Adderall combo much more functional and enjoyable. So on the days I do want to do Adderall I should stay at about 250mg total before, after, and maybe in the middle under. NAC 250mg  doses before. Agmatine dosed 250mg before, 100mg r-ala before.  Combated to the double or triple dose of Agmatine before and also only half of the NAC Dose? And then do another 250 at the end. I add 200mg Co-coq10 as a long duration antioxidating that will still somer trough my next go. And tro to not dose any supplements 12/24 hours before said Adderall trip?  Will get back on trip report later.  And in Thor's for other drug days NAC, Agmatine and r-ala should be cut in half?

Hi ya'll! After hearing so much about this subreddit, and having followed it without actively going through it for a year, I've finally got the courage to want to start this. My only concern is the world's situation right now. Now, I'm fully aware that I can go and do things indoors but with family, school, and the internet accessible indoors may not necessarily help me in this journey. I have done a good job staying away from social media in general (thanks to minimalism) but I wish there was a way to improve since I still consider myself an addict. Any tips?

It's piss easy to get vaccine in KZ now.  Yet most of my acquaintances are not in any hurry to get vaccinated, expressing distrust in them.   However expats, IT, and upper management folks whom I know are all got vaccine relatively quickly.  I wonder how much of your social bubble got vaccinated?

Hello,  Since the CDC website states that the risk of severe illness due to covid is higher for children under 1 year old or with preexisting conditions—my husband and I were wondering how to handle fully vaccinated grandparents who want to hold our child.  Do they still need to wear masks while holding our baby boy?   Also, my husband and I will be fully vaccinated in one more week. Should we consider continuing to wear masks in public settings until our son is vaccinated or over a year old?  I’ve been reading that the risk of transmission from fully vaccinated people is low, but the recent Yankees outbreak has me concerned.  Any advice would be appreciated!

Hey Guys,  I took the COVID vaccine (AstreZenca) 15 days ago, noticed some rashes on my butt 2 days ago, thought it was some random skin irritation and I ignored it for a 36 hours. Then it got worse, the rashes became painful and I contacted my GI. He took a look at it and diagnosed it as Shingles, have been put on medication now.  Upon looking it up I found following articles -  [https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/herpes-covid-vaccine](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/herpes-covid-vaccine)  [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.27036](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jmv.27036)  [https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keab345/6225015](https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/rheumatology/keab345/6225015)  So, if you are on immuno supressive drugs, please talk to your doctor before talking the vaccine and contact them immediately if you notice anything weird with your body.  **Would I still take the vaccine if I knew about this? YES.**  Please get vaccinated safely after discussing it with your doctor.  Edits: Adding relevant links

Hi everyone. My second dose is due from 7th June and my anxious ass doesn't know where to get the vaccine.  The BMC Twitter handle had posted about walk ins but the age group wasn't mentioned so I'm confused. Has anyone gone to those walk in centres? Are they allowing 18+ people who are due for their second dose. Please drop in private hospitals that are giving second dose of covaxin as well so I can start searching. I need to get vaccinated before the 21st so I'm hoping stock will be made available by then. Appreciate the help, stay safe!

In a country of virus deniers, how do you even convince your family, friends and acquaintances to get themselves vaccinated?  I work for an academic institution and as per government instructions and given NCOC, we are supposed to get vaccinated ASAP. I am stunned to see how none of my acquaintances are willing to go for it regardless of the ease provided. They are consistent over the notion that vaccines are yahoodi sazish.   Additional cringe : Most of them are PhDs, Post Docs.

Kia ora all. So over the last couple of months there has been some hefty criticisms portraying the governments vaccine rollout plan as poorly executed and there being constant "shifting the goal post" for their population immunization goals.  Are these criticisms founded in reality?   My understanding is that because NZ is in such a good spot (covid-19 wise) in comparison to other countries, we aren't a priority on the vaccine shipment list and subsequently are not receiving as many vaccines as other countries are. (The actual  internal distribution of the limited vaccines has been fine though?)  There may be some issues with the party in powers messaging in that they're not being clear enough, goalposts etc. but considering one side is saying they were always general/flexible in their goals and the other side just saying the opposite so this issue just seems like whatever.   Cheers for any and all opinions

Being diagnosed with cancer is almost always a bolt from the blue, changing life as you have known it, on its head. Adding to that stress now is the ongoing pandemic - COVID 19. A cancer patient is immuno-compromised and therefore at more risk from the coronavirus. However, delaying treatment for fear of the virus may result in cancer advancing to life-threatening stages.

    Although vaccinations and drugs might sometimes interact, these combinations seldom cause major issues. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccination studies included people with a range of medical problems. If you are on drugs, you can still obtain the COVID-19 vaccination. [Tramadol 200mg Online](https://tramadolzone.com/tramadol-200mg/)  You take a medication in the morning for your blood pressure or diabetes, and perhaps a statin at night for your cholesterol. Because of the pandemic, you are now being urged to include a coronavirus vaccine in the mix. While you should visit your doctor if you have any concerns, medical experts believe the great majority of prescription medication will continue to perform just as well after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, and they will not reduce the effectiveness of the coronavirus vaccination.  **How can physicians be so convinced of themselves?**  \-It all boils down to the fact that the majority of the maintenance drugs we take have no effect on the system in your body that the COVID-19 vaccinations affect: your immune system.  According to Adam Berman, M.D., an emergency medicine physician and associate chair of the emergency department at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York, the current vaccines work by exposing a person's body to a small protein from the coronavirus, which induces the immune system to begin fighting the virus as if the person had been fully infected. The goal is that if your body learns to resist the coronavirus when you aren't afflicted, it will be able to protect you afterwards by fighting off the illness swiftly if you become afflicted.  In essence, the vaccination targets your immune system, and “the vast, vast majority of drugs that people take do not influence their immune systems.” [Tramadol 150mg Online](https://tramadolzone.online/product/tramadol-150mg/)  According to William Schaffner, M.D., an epidemiologist and professor of preventive medicine and health policy at Vanderbilt University, the statin you take to control high cholesterol inhibits your cholesterol production and has nothing to do with your immune system. Blood thinners, such as Warfarin or Eliquis, act by interfering with your body's clotting process. Diabetes medications, such as Metformin, operate on your glucose metabolism and have nothing to do with your immune system.  Some medications may reduce the efficacy of vaccines.There are several exceptions, like with most medical science norms. If you are using prescription medications that have an influence on your immune system, the vaccination may not be as effective as it would be if you were not.  If you have had an organ transplant and are taking immunosuppressive drugs, or if you are taking those drugs to treat an autoimmune disease, or if you are taking certain cancer chemotherapies, the “immunosuppressive drug could decrease the efficacy of the vaccine,” according to William Moss, M.D., executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The same is true for those who are HIV positive and use one or more immune-suppressing drugs.  Nonetheless, Schaffner notes that such treatments, as well as the COVID-19 vaccination, will continue to act on the illnesses for which they are prescribed. [Tramadol 225MG Online](https://tramadolworld.com/product/tramadol-225-mg/)  **Should you still be vaccinated?**  Schaffner inquires, alluding to the COVID-19 vaccinations now available from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. “Without a doubt. Can we now ensure that you will have 95% protection? No, however you will be protected to somSe extent. And anything is preferable to nothing."  Moss proposes that individuals think about COVID immunizations in the same way they think about their yearly flu shot, shingles, or pneumonia vaccination. The COVID vaccine "is a novel vaccination, yet it is basically a vaccination." It is similar to other vaccinations in that it affects our immune system. There's also no need to be concerned about how it could interact with other medications."

I’m hoping someone in the same boat as I am has some information they can share that helped them.   I’ve been battling the acid reflux for about a year now and am at wits end. Im taking omeprezol, which really helped at first. It’s still better now than before I got in it but I’ve started getting heartburn and feeling bloated again   Orange juice is a big trigger for me, I’ve realized that and recently eliminated it. I’m still trying to figure out what else does this and how to get rid of it   Some nights it is crippling. I’ve literally thought I was dying, the acid was so hot and painful   I burp so much that it could fill up a hot air balloon. I’m only 185 pounds, I don’t even get how it’s possible   I currently don’t have health insurance. When I did, my doctor prescribed the omeprezol. I’m wondering what else works either natural remedy or OTC or really whatever is best

Hey guys! Like a Hijabi girl lived in Morocco since 3 years , i noticed that Our society is divided into two groups .  *The first group is the " Open-minded " or not religious people ...They always look at us 'Hijabis' with an inferior look, like we are backward, uneducated, like we still in the Middle Ages and they treat us accordingly. (Without generalization).   *The second group: they though that girls without hijab are Disrespectful and scandalous girls...And those girls are looking for harassment.. which is totally wrong!!

Hi everyone!  The team in Southampton UK have been researching a new vaccine for whooping cough. We are however struggling with participant recruitment due to the pandemic. Does anyone have any advice or tips on how we can improve and get the message out that we are actively looking for people interested in helping us with this research? This is from a participant perspective opposed to a job advert. We are desperate to get this phase of the research completed (initial results look interesting we just need more data!)  We are a small team researching a controlled human colonisation model of Bordetella pertussis. We give a small dose of bacteria to healthy individuals, monitor them for 14 days before giving them a course of antibiotics. We are now in the second part of the study, having published the first part in early 2020 ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562530/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31562530/)). Participants are reimbursed up to £1,000 for participation. We don't have a budget for large advertising but I could make a case if other researchers have had success with something.  Participants are now seen as outpatients but we are struggling more now than ever before. Any help, advice or participation is greatly received!!

    According to specialists, skipping the second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine series can diminish the efficiency and, perhaps, the duration of your protection.  Both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines allow you to book an appointment for a second COVID-19 dosage up to 42 days following your initial shot.  A full COVID-19 immunisation for the vast majority of Americans entails sitting for a series of two distinct doses manufactured by the teams behind Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine products. According to current FDA recommendations, patients must wait at least 21 days for a second Pfizer dosage; those who receive Moderna shots must wait at least 28 days. Professionals refer to these second doses as "booster" shots since they are intended to "boost" your immunity. [Tramadol 225mg online](https://onlinetramadolzone.com/product/tramadol-225-mg/)  Others are scared to return for a second shot after experiencing a very painful arm or a slew of negative effects from the first. A lesser number of patients may simply be unable to attend their scheduled second dosage appointment due to unforeseen circumstances, and rescheduling can be just as difficult as arranging a first-time appointment.  Your CDC-issued immunisation card will frequently include information on when you should return for a second dose, ensuring as much immunity against life-threatening COVID-19 instances as possible. Even if you can't make that date, it's still in your best interest to get a second dose — rather than trying to get a different dose or "start over" with immunizations.  **Why is a second booster dosage necessary?**  You must sit for both doses of your Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccination in order for it to be as successful as possible. According to BBC reporting and the World Health Organization, Pfizer's vaccine is only 52 percent effective in stopping the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that leads to a COVID-19 diagnosis) after one dosage, but Moderna's vaccine might be over 80 percent effective in the first two weeks. According to the CDC, both vaccinations are well over 90% effective at preventing life-threatening instances of COVID-19 during a brief period following two complete doses.  Although research indicate that immunity develops in some form after the first dosage, the same data also reveals that vaccinated individuals are completely immunised by just two weeks of the second dosage. "Antibodies can grow tenfold after the second treatment," adds Dr. Kman. "This second injection is especially crucial in those with weakened immune systems who are at high risk of serious consequences or symptoms." [Tramadol 150mg Online](https://tramadolzone.online/product/tramadol-150mg/)  **What kind of protection does a single shot against COVID-19 provide?**  There has been little investigation into how a single dose of a two-series vaccine might affect long-term immunity against COVID-19, although preliminary evidence indicate that a major source of protection may be obtained with only one injection. Dr. Kman notes that in a pool of 3,950 trial participants from six different states over a 13-week period, a single dose of both vaccinations was shown to be 80 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 infections. "Following a single dose of either vaccine, the participants' risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was lowered by 80% two or more weeks later," he says. "It's worth noting that all of the vaccinations, including Johnson &amp; Johnson's, are 100 percent effective in avoiding mortality from COVID-19, which is likely the most critical objective."  All of the specialists we spoke with agreed that even if you are over the 42-day mark, you should still schedule a booster dosage for the optimal effects. Dr. Nagrani explains that due to a lack of evidence at this time, it's unknown whether the efficacy of the vaccination differs when someone takes a booster dose after a 42-day delay. "It's logical to think that the vaccination remains efficacious if the series is spread out farther," he adds, "but evidence to support this isn't available at this moment."

Hi r/chodi. I am a Sikh. I often lurk this subreddit, to see what's the perspective of the indian RW on ongoing events. I wanted to make one thing clear to you guys, the title.  The reason Christianity is spreading in Punjab because Sikhs are no longer walking on the path told by our gurus.  **LOWER CASTES FORM MORE THAN 95% OF CHRISTIAN CONVERTS.**  Our gurus taught lessons of equality and no caste based discrimination. But Upper caste sikhs, majorly Jatts(Punjabi version of Jats) are too obesessed with caste, to the point that almost 90% punjabi songs contain the word Jatt. I am myself a Jatt and find it too cringey. Lower caste sikhs are not treated as equals by them. Lower caste sikhs came into sikhi fold because it promised them equal rights and better treatment, but the majority sikh population instead of treating them as equals still sees them as lower.  Also lower caste sikhs generally tend to be poor, and christian missionaries offer them money. Free education for their children, etc. Heck I have seen a Hindu guy who wasn't Dalit but converted, wasn't practicing tho. He mentioned all the benifits of converting for the sake of it.  TLDR : Converts are lower caste people, who also happen to be poor, who think by converting they will get better status in society, and also lots of benifits are provided to them by the missionaries like free schooling, money on conversion etc.  I am not a fan of you guys' beliefs like hating on Muslims among others. But I felt, as you guys are always talking about rising christianity in Punjab, you guys should be told the real reason. The ricebag shit you guys believe is not the case atleast for Punjab, may be so in other states. I'll even go as far as to say if I was in the place of most converts, I would too. Why wouldn't I if I am still being treated on basis of caste in Sikhism, If i convert atleast my children would get free education and I'll get some fuckin' money. Hence it boils down to human desire for a better life.  P.S : I am sad at the plight of sikhs in punjab, who are going astray from the guru's path of love, peace and sacrifice. May Waheguru/Ram/Allah bless us all and may peace prevail.     Edit : Many are asking WHY SIKHS VOTED CONGRESS. Here's my response :   [https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/nprdj8/real\_reason\_why\_christianity\_is\_spreading\_in/h06nrjn?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chodi/comments/nprdj8/real_reason_why_christianity_is_spreading_in/h06nrjn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

There is one string of hope.  Whenever you hold a social gathering, invite them but explain that everyone should be vaccinated.   I have a lot of right wing brainwashed "but her emails" family that would almost rather die than ever admit they were wrong or that Trump was wrong. (a lot of people are doing this because conservative leaders downplayed the virus for political  reasons and they don't want to admit that the conservative leaders misled them)   But when my cousin got married, they said "you gotta vaccinate to attend" and they did. Even my right wing uncle  who has been a relentless trump supporter since the day he announced his presidential run, went and got a vaccine.    I've told people they must vaccinate to meet my child and they mostly comply, either that or they don't get to meet my kid.  I will say you're not going to make any headway with randoms on the internet. You're not going to make any headway posting this shit online, but when people are confronted in person and told 'you must vaccinate to keep others safe" a lot of them do it.

It's basically a Telegram Channel with a bot that periodically checks some publicly available practices for appointments. Give it a try, if you want.  https://t.me/joinchat/-FK3fi1VWgNhNGRi  **Disclaimer**: The data is only as good as its source, especially the appoinments scraped from doctolib are somewhat dodgy (may fade in and out of existence constantly or not be bookable at all).

Hello all! Does anyone else have experience with taking low-dose troches each day?   I was recently prescribed daily ketamine troches in the hopes of prolonging the time period between my IV infusions. So far I’ve only been able to go about two weeks without getting hooked up to an IV pump... The troches are 30mg, which I know is rather low compared to the 100-300mg troche dosages that are out there. For reference, I’m F, around 5’4, \~130lbs, and my infusions are at 140mg.  I’m very new to taking troches so if you wouldn’t mind sharing – what time of day do you usually take your troches? How often at what dose? How do you personally take your troches? And are there any special before/after recommendations?   Any and all comments are appreciated and good luck to everyone else here!

 Hey there. I'll keep this kinda vague for anonymity reasons but I think it's all the info needed. On mobile and english is not my native language, so sorry in advance.  My friend is in her early twenties and has a really weak immune system. She's trying to find a diagnosys for the stomach pain she has since she was young, but still hasn't find anything other than being celiac and some other food alergies. She might have some undiagnosed auto-immune.  Basically, no one knows what she has, but every little thing she gets turns into a big thing cause of her weak immune system. For example, a small herpes in her lip turned her full face red and itchy, even with medication.  Now she went to some immunologist and he said she couldn't take the covid vaccine because there could be "complications"... A few weeks ago another doctor advised to stay a couple days in the hospital after the vaccine to manage the symptoms, but now this doctor said this and my friend and her parents basically gave up on the vaccine (at least for now)  I'm no doctor, but isn't the risk of NOT having the vaccine waaaay higher for someone with a weak (really weak, maybe?) immune system, than the risk of some complication after getting the shot?

I have an EU passport and UK car, I'd like to drive from London to Italy tomorrow at my parent's place.    I don't plan to stop in Germany (perhaps just for fuel), I plan to purely transit through Germany. I'm planning to take an antigen test before starting the drive (I received my first vaccine dose 6 days ago and are able to prove it through barcode in NHS App if that helps)     **This** [**link from UK**](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/germany/entry-requirements) **gov says:**  *"According to* [*Federal Interior Ministry guidance*](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/coronavirus-faqs.html#doc13797140bodyText3) *and the* [*German Embassy*](https://uk.diplo.de/uk-de/coronavirus?openAccordionId=item-2430246-2-panel)  *in London, transit through Germany by land with a private vehicle is  currently not possible because of the UK’s designation as a virus  variant area of concern."*     **But,** [for example this link](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/faqs/EN/topics/civil-protection/coronavirus/coronavirus-faqs.html#doc13797140bodyText3)**, from German federal ministry of interior, says:**   *"Transit within, from or to Schengen*  On travels from, to or within Schengen passing through Germany and when leaving Germany via the fastest route available the following applies:  * *The digital entry registration and quarantine do not apply.* * *A* [*negative test or proof of vaccination or recovery*](https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/einreiseundaufenthalt/coronavirus#9) ***is necessary for***         * *All air-travels to Germany and*    * ***After a stay in an*** [***area of variant of concern***](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Transport/Archiv_Risikogebiete/Risikogebiete_aktuell_en.pdf?__blob=publicationFile)***.

Sorry I can't speak Greek.   Me and my wife have permanent residency in Greece.   We are actually Turkish.  My question is:  &gt;"What is the arrival procedure to Greece for a permanent resident if her/his PCR test is covid positive?"  Why I am asking this?  We have the chance to get vaccinated for covid in Turkey. (sinovac)   We already got our first dose of vaccine 25 days ago.   Soon we will go to Turkey for the second dose.   And we will return to Greece on the same day.  But,I heard that a person may test positive after first shot of the vaccine as he/she develops antigens. (or may even test as false positive)   So after taking our vaccine shots ,when coming back To Greece from Turkey, if our PCR test returns positive.   What are the arrival conditions for a permanent resident in a situation like that?  We have 2 cats, because of that we have to get back to Greece as soon as possible.   We have nobody to look after them.  I checked PLF Greece site. [https://travel.gov.gr](https://travel.gov.gr/#/)In website it strictly says that to be able to enter country  1. you have to give a negative test result or 2. your vaccination is completed and certified at least 14 days ago or 3. you have to be tested positive at least 2-6 months before your entrance  For a situation like ours if our PCR tests return negative there seems no problem.(like in our first shot)But there is a great possibility that our tests may return positive as we got the first shot already.  So in a condition like that neither of the above 3 conditions met for us.  What is the arrival procedure for a permanent resident in a situation like that ?  Is your entrance rejected ?  We have to wait for 14 days for number 2 ?  &gt;your vaccination is completed and certified at least 14 days ago or  or is there some kind of self isolation procedure or hotel isolation procedure?  What if I have children in Greece for example?  Is the procedure same for also Greek citizens ?

I got my first dose (AZ) while working abroad so this isn't reflected on the NHS system, and I'm due for my second dose in the coming weeks no that they're doing over 30's.  I've tentatively booked the appointment for my second dose (or 'first' as far as NHS is concerned) so obviously just want to be sure I'm not going to go down there and queue up only to find out it's a different vaccine. There are no clues in the booking process so just hoping anyone who's been done recently or if anyone is working down there might be able to advise?  Edit - Thanks to all who responded. Went down this morning, spoke to the marshals outside and it baffled them a bit but agreed to let me queue up directly for 2nd dose, got inside and was directed to Check In deck no 18 (she seems to be the wizard who can sort these things), she fiddled my record accordingly in the system and I got my second dose without any issues 👍🏻

I'd prefer to take it just once in the morning since it can be difficult to fit it in late at night with a meal and I'm not in that much pain during the night and I'd also like to reduce the dose so its less stress on my stomach. But I just wondered if there's any dangers to taking it just once a day for this type of medication or if it needs to be in my system 24 hours a day?

Hello,   I have been using Fin for a long time now. I used Fin 1mg everyday for 6 months, experienced mild sexual side effects. After that I quit for a week, felt much better and like brand new. Then I restarted Fin with 0,5 ~ 0,6 mg / 3~4x week and it’s been a month now, still experience mild effects. I’m thinking of doing a 0,25mg / 3x week as my last resort.  My question is - how do I do this? Do I need to take a break for 1 month to clear everything out? Or should I just continue on with the new dose, without taking a break?  I would just quit for a month and then start again with the smaller dose, but I’m 100% sure I will loose some ground by doing this, and I’m really scared of that. When I took a break for a week and then restarted, the shedding came back and I lost some ground. I am literally at the edge right now of my hairloss being visible and not, so I’m scared to loose more ground.   Any advice please, this is really stressful and a hard decision to make.

After googling and googling and googling I give up!  What I’m looking for is a simple list of vaccinations administered and to how many patients in total - split up by vaccine (Pfizer/Moderna/Johnson&amp;Johnson). I would also like, if possible, the number of side effects/fatalities for each vaccine.   Can anyone point me in the right direction/have a link to this please?  For more clarity I would like to see the equivalent of this which is on the UK government website:  *This safety update report is based on detailed analysis of data up to 19 May 2021. At this date, an estimated 12.7 million first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and 24.2 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca had been administered, and around 10.5 million and 10.7 million second doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca respectively. An approximate 0.3 million first doses of the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna have also now been administered*  The site then goes on to list all the reported side effects and fatalities for each vaccine.  Thanks so much :)

Hey all,  I just returned from traveling to a country that is orange-listed. My roommate is in an at-risk group, and we have been minimizing every risk he might be at (I left to get vaccinated, have been tested regularly and taken every precaution I can, and I will be staying in my separate room all day) to minimize contact between us as much as possible.   This might seem stupid but he has been worried about the covid enforcement officers coming up into our apartment since they are in contact with people who have been traveling and may not have been careful all day. I am happy that they are finally checking that people follow the quarantine, so I really don't have an issue with them coming up (I think he may also be a bit paranoid, I am sure they are very careful), but I wanted to find out if they come up or just ring the intercom to speak to you to give him some peace of mind (and make him stop asking me about it).  Thanks

Hi All, hope everyone is coping well despite the ongoing pandemic (I hope it is ok to post this here - happy for it to be removed if not). I am a member of a large international survey project looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the entire population of countries, including people in Wales (and Pontypridd!). The project involves almost 200 investigators in more than 35 countries and has been endorsed by multiple national and international professional organizations and ethical approval has also been obtained from the University of Southampton (for the UK side of the project) and from Aberystwyth University (for the Welsh side of the project specifically). The COH-FIT project aims to identify risk and protective factors that will inform prevention and intervention programs for the COVID-19 pandemic and should other pandemics occur in the future. We are hoping if anyone is kind enough to spend just about 30mins on this survey - we will be so grateful to you. The findings will be of huge importance in improving our understanding of the impact of the pandemic and how to cope with it. Here's more info about the project: [https://www.coh-fit.com/](https://www.coh-fit.com/) and the survey (Diolch yn fawr!): [https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D](https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D)

6 days till I get my second dose of Pfizer. I guess this means I have built up a tiny amount of protection from my first dose 15 days ago. But does this protection mostly stop me from getting infected, or mostly stop me from developing severe symptoms if I do get infected?  And if I do get infected, what happens to my second dose?

So when we compare Inovio to Novavax or Curevac valuation there is huge potential for 7x - 15x in the short term if we see progress in the covid vaccine 🚀  I am thinking about increasing my position significantly and was wondering what do you think about the potential market outlook.  A few points I have in mind:  * When can we expect first orders when the stage 3 trial will start this summer and goes smoothly. I guess Q4/Q1? * It was mentioned that countries for trials will be selected in cooperation with the CRO who has experience in several countries outside of the US. Do we know who the CRO is and which countries are potential targets? * Inovio partnered with chinese Advaccine to push trials there. [China is planning to vaccinate 50-60% by end of this summer but their vaccines seem to have a rather low efficacy rate](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/30/china-forces-pace-of-vaccinations-with-persuasion-and-some-cash). So it looks like they already have quite some supply and it will come down for Inovio to wheter China wants to upgrade with new vaccines for better efficacy rate.

I'm a 15 year old with anxiety, and in about 20 minutes I'm getting my first covid vaccine. Which is great, I'm glad to get vaccinated to help spread coronavirus less. But the problem is I'm really scared of needles. I'm sweating right now in the car on the way and I feel nauseous. Does anyone have any advice for how to calm down and help ease my fear of needles? Thanks

if you don't already know Jan Fawcett is famous for treating his anhedonic patients using pramipexole and this is his research [https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15060788](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15060788)   But on reddit and other sites they consider pramipexole as last resort only because of severe side effects. So I'm wondering what are these side effects ? are they permanent or avoidable ? I know of DAWS ( Dopamine agonist withdrawal syndrome ) but is it avoidable if I taper the med and not quit cold turkey and if not how long does it last ?

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57309538) reduced by 59%. (I'm a bot) ***** &gt; The experiment in Serrana, in the south-eastern S&amp;atilde;o Paulo state, was carried out between February and April by Instituto Butantan, which produces the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China&amp;#039;s Sinovac Biotech.  &gt; Deaths fell by 95%.Hospitalisations fell by 86%.Symptomatic cases fell by 80%. Ricardo Palacios, research director at Butantan, said the key figure was the 75%. &amp;quot;The most important result is that we can control the pandemic without having to vaccinate the whole population,&amp;quot; he said.  &gt; Mr Palacios also said there was a decline in the number of cases among children and teenagers, who had not been vaccinated.  &gt; According to Mr Palacios, the vaccine was also effective against the variant originally known as P.1, and now called Gamma, that was first identified in the northern city of Manaus and has been blamed for a surge in cases across the country.  &gt; There was some controversy about the vaccine this year, after clinical trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey put its efficacy in a range of 50% to 90%. The CoronaVac is an inactivated vaccine, and works by using killed viral particles to expose the body&amp;#039;s immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response.  &gt; There were no reports of severe side effects from the vaccine and no Covid-related deaths among those who had been vaccinated 14 days after the second shot was applied, the results showed.   ***** [**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-57309538) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ "531742 summaries so far.") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **vaccine**^#1 **vaccinate**^#2 **cases**^#3 **death**^#4 **population**^#5  Post found in [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/npsbzv/brazil_covid_deaths_plunge_after_towns_adults/).  *NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.

It's about as dumb as going up to a gay bar and saying "Why do they get a bar? Why is there no straight bar?"  Go make one! Who's stopping you?  "I hate America, burn the flag." MOVE THEN, DON'T STAY!  Asking why they have a pride month, not agreeing with pride month, thinking the UK is 10× better, thinking America needs to abolish police, thinking America sucks etc. etc... that's all fine, do I agree? No, but you are entitled to that opinion. Just don't whine about it and demand others change for you.  Those examples aren't all I see, just some common ones, my point stands for most if not everything in life.  Take it into your own hands and do what makes you happy because others won't do it for you.  I'm no activist, I just hate whiners.  Happy pride month everyone, hope you had a good Memorial day.  Edit: pride month isn't "Hate on everyone not LBGTQ+ month". I can't believe I had to say this. Thanks so far this comment section is being very respectful.

Hi everyone. Newbie here. I am a microdoser, but do occasionally enjoy a recreational dose. My first grow is producing fruits (GT) and I picked a few mature ones to dry. 5.5g wet/.67g dry.  I wanted to test dose myself, and doing a little research I originally had decided I would make my microdoses around 250mg dry weight.   I ground up my .67g and mixed in with orange juice and drank it. My reasoning behind taking the whole .67g was I wanted to make a judgement on potency, and didn’t want to take a microdose because I wanted to be able to notice it, so I could calculate my dosages based on the experience.   And *feel it I did.*  I’m no stranger to recreational doses, so I made myself ready for it just in case. One thing I was a stranger to was how it came on. 20 minutes after ingesting, my body felt like it had a sudden drop. Immediately I had a head high. I was thinking it was under a gram dry, maybe this will be it.   It was not.   I had a slight sense of immobility, until I actually moved and my body felt free, something I haven’t experienced while tripping before. Over the next two hours, it was a fairly intense trip. The third and final hour I felt pretty much back to normal, but back to the head high.  I’m shocked at how such a small dose did so much.   I’m looking for advice now on how to get a good microdose, I’m almost afraid to even try .1g as a microdose, especially if I’m going out. I’m glad I tested it before assuming my original idea of .2g microdose and taking it and going out the door. I suppose this will be a trial and error type situation. Any advice from microdosers, or recreational users will be greatly appreciated!  10/10 love my new hobby

My girlfriend and I somehow managed to get two reservations. Drove there after work. I would estimate at the very least a couple of thousand young people, all spending their bank holiday Monday trying to get vaccinated.  Super inspiring to see everyone there!   Apart from a sore arm, I’m feeling pretty ok. Hoping it stays that way in coming days.

Eu ainda tô na escola, e lá o respeito as medidas de proteção está quase 0, primeiro que já teve caso de professor ficar sem máscara e chegar perto dos alunos, é algo ridiculo. E eles falaram que a cada duas semanas (ou algo do tipo), iriam testar os professores e em três dias dariam os resultados, se passou 7 dias, eu tive três professores afastados e eles não falaram nada, não informaram se eles estão com covid ou se estão doentes, só afastaram... Alguns desses professores, nas aulas usavam máscaras de pano, as vezes tiravam e não higienizavam as mesas depois de usar.  As escolas tem obrigação de falar qual professor está positivo para covid? Eles informam se estão fazendo testes  de covid?

So I’m 21 weeks pregnant and am struggling with the decision whether to get the Covid vaccine or not. My appointment is on Thursday so I need to decide ASAP. I’m in Canada, and the current case numbers in my province are 500 active cases, with only 17 new cases yesterday. So my risk is low, but obviously not 100% risk free. If I weren’t pregnant I wouldn’t even be questioning getting the vaccine or not; I just hate the little to no research that has been done on the vaccine in pregnant woman. What is everyone else thinking?

Requested info:  Age: 28  Sex: Male  Height: 6' 2" (1.88 M)  Weight: 180 Lbs  &amp;#x200B;  It has been 6 weeks since I got my first dose of Pfizer. I had COVID back in December. After my first dose, I felt about the same (headache for 1-2 days, some mental fogginess, fatigue) as when I actually had COVID, so my PCP suggested that I could delay the second dose and take it 6-12 weeks after the first dose rather than waiting 3 weeks after the first dose without having to restart from the first dose.  &amp;#x200B;  What are the implications, in terms of being considered "fully vaccinated," of waiting, say, 12 weeks to get the second dose?

This may come across as biased as I’m a 23, almost 24 year old guy who like most people has lost a lot of social interaction due to the pandemic, I still see friends and family when I can but it’s not the same. Slowly things have begun opening back up here in Scotland like shops and gyms and now pubs and I went out this weekend because I’m honestly not even scared of the virus at this point I’m just frustrated with the way the politicians here have handled it.   First off in a city not too far from me there’s been a big spike in cases due to protests, football fans partying in the street and large groups of people crowding up for various political and social justice reasons and yet the politicians fail to see these occurrences as reasons  as to why cases have risen and if so they just get a slap on the wrist meanwhile young people are looked down on for wanting their social lives back and the ability to see friends and family when the majority have done as they were told at the start of this pandemic when it came to only going out when necessary and social distancing. Also don’t beg me constantly in advertising and social media to get the vaccine for months when it isn’t available, it’s just became available for registration now but who knows how long it’ll take them to move that on.  Anyway I would write more but I think my head would explode pointing out all the mistakes and lies that have occurred due to the handling of this pandemic.

A mémet kommnetálva: Biden zseniális megoldása az lenne, hogy újabb adókat emelne - nem mintha a nagy vállalatok nem lobbizták volna ki mindig, hogy ők mentesüljenek, különben elhagyják az országot, vagy nem támogatják az aktuális politikus kampányát.

This is my first comeback with TXT.  When they announced Freeze as the comeback concept, I was really excited. It was the perfect name to start the Chaos Chapter.  Actually, I was expecting a badass concept. But when I listened to Ice Cream, Anti-Romantic and 0X1 Lovesong I wasn't disappointed either.  I always react to a new album as the tracklist order suggests. And Dear Sputnik came up.  Dude I somehow thought it was talking about the Sputnik V vaccine, and that they were thanking the vaccine for existing and I was like WTF. The heroic rhythm didn't help, it put me into a thank-you outro vibe, compared to the rest of the songs.  I'm wheezing.

I turn 17 in a few days but that still is not 18 and I need parent permission to get vaccinated. My Mom is anti vax so I can not get vaccinated even though I want to. Is it possible to get vaccinated?????  Edit: Yes I do have a dad who is willing, but my mom won't let him.

I’m not gonna ask about a particular support case, but I’ve been a bit concerned because the thing I read they should get get back within 24-48 hours on the ticket for my question/issue. And the last update about it that I sent to them was on the 25th, which was asking if I could send them photos of the item and box, which I responded that I could send photos of the item but I do not know where to do so on their site or what email to go thru for it and for assistance on that matter of where to do so to them.  Is it normal for them to take about more than 4 business days to respond? (I would say a week as that is how long it has been, technically, but We did have a weekend that just ended and yesterday was technically a holiday too, so it probably has been 4 business days for them)  This case has been open for like 3 weeks now, I’m worried if I’m running out of time since it said something that items can only be replaced or so if it was still within like 30 days of shipment and I fear the time it takes to hear back is purposely running the clock down until it is considered too old to have the problem fixed, or do they only consider the 30 days thing being just between  when I get the item to when the first ticket is filed?  Anyways, I know there is still a pandemic impacting procedures and ohhand staff, thus because of that what should be a better length of time to wait? Or what should be my next step?

I’ve been lurking here for a long time and decided to post a request I've been thinking about for a while but never made...  I'm 37, single, educated, love my job, and have played it safe for the past year. Haven't met strangers. Haven't had sex. But now that I'm done getting my shots, I'm ready to let loose and just go wild.   (Safely.)  I want to break out of this blowjob rut. (If you give bad blowjobs, I probably won't even notice!) If it's good, I would be eternally grateful. If it's great, I'll tell all of Reddit about you. If you want reciprocation, it would be my pleasure.  A little about me: I'm 5'9", about 155 lbs, and a frequent biker/hiker.  It's not that I'm new to this. I have had fun in the past and have pictures (and a video!) to show for it... but it's been too long since I've done something impulsive and exciting like this. I figured I might as well make it worthwhile.  I'm only looking for women. I can host in the western suburbs or travel to you. If you'd like to get drinks first, that's fine! Got questions? Let me know!

28 F, non smoker, 122 pounds. No significant medical history other than anxiety and gallbladder removal 3 months ago. About a month or so back I was put on Hydroxizine 25 mg for sleep/anxiety and allergies. Last night it was one of those nights where I would fall asleep and then wake up what felt like every 30 minutes. I would be so sleepy and almost fall asleep again but my brain would wake me up. Should I go in and ask for a higher dose or should I just see it last night was a bad night? I was taking Aleve PM before I got on hydroxizine but 2 of them would make me feel like I was asleep all day the next day.

  Maryland resident, job is located in Delaware.  As the title states, I was offered a job with a sizable pay increase, and I turned in my notice at my previous job of 17 years.  On Friday, my new employer contacts me to remind me of everything to bring for my first day (was supposed to be today), including my COVID-19 vaccination card.   I don’t have a COVID-19 vaccination card because I’m not vaccinated.  It wasn’t mentioned at any time during the interview process, nor was it mentioned in my offer letter.   When I told the HR director that I’m not vaccinated, ultimately the offer was rescinded. She told me that they couldn’t wait until I received both doses and would move in to another candidate.   I have a signed offer letter, and that’s why I left my former employer. Going back is not an option.  I’ve already put a deposit down on a new condo close to the new job. Do I have any options?   I’m not anti vaxx, I have had life threatening blood clot issues, and my identical twin (also major blood clot issues) had a rare reaction to the vaccine. I’ve been advised by my doc to wait for further testing.  My doctor provided a letter stating his opinion and HR didn’t budge.

My tank can cycle 4ppm of ammonia in about 2 days. I dosed it yesterday at 1:50 am yesterday morning. It’s now down to 1ppm. I’m assuming it’ll be 0 by the time I get up tomorrow. Nitrites are .25, (mostly a bluish color) but I’m also assuming it’ll go down once all the ammonia is gone.   Should I dose it to 4ppm again or should I dose to a lesser amount? It’s a 10 gallon tank that will only house a betta, maybe two African frogs, and snails. I’m still debating about the frogs.   Thanks.

Hi all,  # I ended up going with the [Mountain Hardwear Rook™ 15F/-9C Sleeping Bag](https://www.mountainhardwear.com/rook-15f--9c-reg-%7C-516-%7C-reg-888663203767.html) since it was 30% off (189.99), it was one of the better bags, and I could actually get it when I needed it. Everyone else had a 10 week lead time! Thanks for the advice!  I have been researching sleeping bags and quilts and have come up with quite a few good options, but shipping on them is weeks away. I am looking to purchase something for early next week at the latest. The options I came up with are Kelty cosmic 20 down, UGQ Bandit, Katabatic, and Hammock Gear Economy Burrow. Only the Kelty is available at $160, but I read it might not sleep well at 20F. I am willing to spend into the $300 range for something I won't regret purchasing when I am shivering in the middle of the night because I cheaped out.  Any other recommendations of something that is reasonably priced and in stock? I am looking at a 20F because I would like to cover a wide range of environments, but will also consider 15F or so. I intend on using this on a road trip in my car or in a tent lasting between 2-4 weeks.  I would also appreciate some tent recommendations if you have any.  Need: Sleeping Bag/Quilt  Price: \~&lt;=$300  Temp: \~20F  Fill Material: Down, but will consider synthetic  Me: Male, 5' 8", 180lbs  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you!

But there has to be some level of visual stimulus.      Looking forward meeting eager people who feel lonely and horny during this difficult time.      **Chat or Pm** is okay.

If you do that though, please use the HTML link rather than the Google Sheets one because otherwise it really slows it down when I'm uploading the data.  * **Throwback** Ontario June 1 update: 404 New Cases, 343 Recoveries, 10 Deaths, 14,379  tests (2.81% positive), Current ICUs: 161 (+5 vs. yesterday)  (-14 vs. last week)   ------------------------------------------------------------  **Testing data:** - [Source](https://data.ontario.ca/dataset/status-of-covid-19-cases-in-ontario)  * Backlog: 15,490 (+8,403), 20,262 tests completed (2,706.9 per 100k in week) --&gt; 28,665 swabbed * Positive rate (Day/Week/Prev Week): 3.45% /  3.58% /  5.29% - [Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7fegCALd11ElozUYcMi-e9Dj69YaiNQhvEpk81JHsyTACl0UXkWK5zfMNFe49Tq3VuN9Av-fuEZqV/pubchart?oid=1660579214&amp;format=interactive)  **Episode date data (day/week/prev. week)** - [Cases by episode date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7fegCALd11ElozUYcMi-e9Dj69YaiNQhvEpk81JHsyTACl0UXkWK5zfMNFe49Tq3VuN9Av-fuEZqV/pubchart?oid=1644344261&amp;format=interactive) and [historical averages of episode date](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7fegCALd11ElozUYcMi-e9Dj69YaiNQhvEpk81JHsyTACl0UXkWK5zfMNFe49Tq3VuN9Av-fuEZqV/pubchart?oid=1644344261&amp;format=interactive)  * New cases with episode dates in last 3 days: 306 / 459 / 786 (-239 vs. yesterday week avg) * New cases - episode dates in last 7 days: 491 / 749 / 1,267 (-430 vs. yesterday week avg) * New cases - ALL episode dates: 699 / 1,029 / 1,692 (-585 vs. yesterday week avg)  **Other data:**  * 7 day average: 1,030 (-48 vs. yesterday) (-663 or -39.2% vs. last week), (-2,558 or -71.3% vs. 30 days ago) * Active cases: 11,689 (-878 vs. yesterday) (-7,337 vs. last week) - [Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7fegCALd11ElozUYcMi-e9Dj69YaiNQhvEpk81JHsyTACl0UXkWK5zfMNFe49Tq3VuN9Av-fuEZqV/pubchart?oid=1136841100&amp;format=interactive) * Current hospitalizations: 804(+73), ICUs: 583(-34), Ventilated: 387(+5), [vs. last week: -221 / -109 / -111] - [Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQ7fegCALd11ElozUYcMi-e9Dj69YaiNQhvEpk81JHsyTACl0UXkWK5zfMNFe49Tq3VuN9Av-fuEZqV/pubchart?oid=1392680472&amp;format=interactive) * **New variant cases** (UK/RSA/BRA): +762 / +1 / +45  - [This data lags quite a bit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/ls8ohl/ontario_february_25_update_1138_new_cases_1094/gopq2kb/) * ICU count by [Ontario Health Region](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/54585/ontario-taking-next-steps-to-integrate-health-care-system) (vs. last week): North: 21(+0), East: 94(-19), Toronto: 89(-28), Central: 142(-29), West: 152(-28),  * Based on death rates from completed cases over the past month, 4.1 people from today's new cases are expected to die of which 0.4 are less than 50 years old, and 0.7, 0.9, 1.3, 0.9 and -0.0 are in their 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s respectively.

The Step 2/3 calculations are really 90 and 105 doses per 100 adults. I should be projecting 2nd doses separately but the second dose average right now is really low so it would be misleading. * The reopening metrics also include *'other health metrics'* that have not been specified so these dates are not the dates that ALL of the reopening step criteria have been met.

I have a friend who went to a covid rally in London this past weekend and when I got talking to him he said that 1200+ people have died from the vaccine, some have had allergic reactions and many have had adverse reactions.  Adverse reactions - just side affects so there's nothing to worry about there.  Allergic reactions - When you're vaccinating an entire world there's gonna be some who are allergic and I think there are consideration doctors take before administering the vaccine based off of if that person has more allergies of whatever.  Deaths after vaccine - I calculated a **rough** estimate for the no. of people I'd expect to die during the time since the first vaccine. So I used 2019 deaths (530,841) (all of this will be UK) \* by fraction of the year (0.4794) to find the no. of deaths in equal time period since first vaccine (254,485). Then adjusted for population increase (257,534). That no. / population \*100% = % of pop. expected to die in this time (0.3809%).  Now we change the pop. to no. of people who've had a vaccine (38,871,200) and use the %expected to die in this time period to find number of vaccinated people who are expected to die in this time (148060).  I feel like 1200+ is a small enough number comparatively that these deaths are probably just unrelated deaths that happen to be after a vaccine coincidentally. I can't find anything online about deaths after vaccine so its hard to make any more meaningful comparison. So does anyone know of data of the number of deaths after a vaccine, does anyone think my comparison has any meaning at all (I know it's not at all scientific) and have I missed anything in explaining why, despite some negatives, the vaccine is overwhelmingly a net positive? Because I think its hugely net positive but can't explain it very well.  [No. of deaths in people who received vaccine (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html)  [Deaths in elderly patients](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1372)  [Fact check: Deaths after vaccine (released by CDC) don't point to a causal relationship](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-vaers-deaths-idUSL1N2MZ2H8)  Edit - sry about that title, I changed what I was gonna say slightly halfway through and forgot to change it too  Also I think these articles I just found answer some of my questions

I’m planning on getting the first dose of the vaccine at the end of this week(if I can) as I know there typically are side effects of vaccines, I went on tumblr(idk why I chose tumblr) to look at the posts about people getting vaccines. And tbh tumblr just started scaring me (also filled with antivaxers wow)   I was wondering if people normally feel bad after the first dose or second? Cause I have a few important tests next week and if I get the first dose this Friday, I don’t want to spend the weekend sick. I don’t mind getting sick for the second dose though cause the vaccine is still better than nothing.

As a teen I got a vaccine that was new like the covid vaccine and my doctor convinced my mom I needed it and everyone was getting it so I got 2 of the 3 doses before the one I got was recalled. Luckily I haven’t had any issues but it scares me. People think I’m a ignorant person because I don’t want to get the covid vaccine right now and want to wait a year and I feel like I can’t even tell them about my personal issue with a vaccine I had because they will tell me it’s different. I’m not one to question medical advice , but is it really different? The vaccine I took was even FDA approved. I’m not saying all vaccines are bad I had all my vaccines as a child, have gotten my flu shot but I’m not a bad person for just being scared of this vaccine being so new and wanting to wait a little bit.

Hi All, hope everyone is coping well despite the ongoing pandemic (I hope it is ok to post this here - happy for it to be removed if not). I am a member of a large international survey project looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the entire population of countries, including people in Wales (and Bridgend!). The project involves almost 200 investigators in more than 35 countries and has been endorsed by multiple national and international professional organizations and ethical approval has also been obtained from the University of Southampton (for the UK side of the project) and from Aberystwyth University (for the Welsh side of the project specifically). The COH-FIT project aims to identify risk and protective factors that will inform prevention and intervention programs for the COVID-19 pandemic and should other pandemics occur in the future. We are hoping if anyone is kind enough to spend just about 30mins on this survey - we will be so grateful to you. The findings will be of huge importance in improving our understanding of the impact of the pandemic and how to cope with it. Here's more info about the project: [https://www.coh-fit.com/](https://www.coh-fit.com/) and the survey (Diolch yn fawr!): [https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D](https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D)

We always knew about his marriage of 2 decades and it just happened to crash after covid’s supposed peak.I know there has been recent news on his infidelity but is that proven? Let’s not forget bill gate happens to be one of the biggest sponsors of the WHO and there are videos of him speaking on earths unpreparedness  for a biological warfare. I think his wife knows something more about covid that the public doesn’t.

My father (55m, race: Caucasian, height: 5.5 feet or 166cm, weight: 93kg or 205 pounds) was diagnosed 5 years ago, doing quite well today, he takes 5 miligrams of prednisone every day, doesn't have any symptoms, but we are worried because of covid,  we aren't sure if he should vaccinate and if yes, which vaccine will be optimal for him. Thanks!

I am in my late 40s, with a comfortable career, a lovely home, and a loving husband and extended family. However, I have found myself increasingly tormented by my sexuality over the past year or so. First, our daughter enlisted in the military, leaving us empty-nesters. Then, when the pandemic hit, my husband still had to go to work, but I was working from home alone all day. My workload is "on demand," so I have at least some downtime most days, and over the past year I've spent time almost every weekday surfing porn.  This constant attention to my sexuality ignited a lot of long-repressed impulses, desires, and fantasies that go back to my teenage years. I have always been fascinated with same-room-sex, swapping partners, group sex, and exhibitionism (solo sex acts for an audience and flashing/dressing provocatively in public). Unfortunately, I am resigned to the fact that none of these things will ever be a part of my real life.  Understand that I have only been with one man, who is truly my best friend. I genuinely love my husband in a million different ways, and I have zero desire to leave my marriage. I should have realized that we were not on the same sexual plane. We have always maintained an active sex life, but it consists solely of very conventional intercourse, always in our bedroom. He dislikes oral sex, giving or receiving. Role-playing, explicit talk, sexual slang, sharing sexy fantasies -- all are offensively "dirty" to him. Early on in our relationship, told him a fantasy I thought was pretty innocent, and he was really weird with me the next couple of times we made love. I finally got him to tell me that it disappointed him to think I might be having "those kinds of thoughts" during sex. He's physically attractive and nicely endowed, however, and when I was younger, I was so glad to be actually having sex I didn't question it.  Don't suggest that he might really have similar unspoken desires that I need to draw out of him.  I am confident that he really is as sexually conservative as he appears. I bought racy lingerie and tried wearing it for him, but it was a total turn-off. He said he wanted me to look like a goddess, not "cheap and easy." When our daughter was an infant, I commented that I found the sensation of breastfeeding rather erotic. That genuinely bothered him. I asked him why and he said he didn't want to talk about it. After that, he would usually get up and leave the room whenever I was nursing her, or at least divert his gaze.  I'm not really looking for advice, but I thought this would be a little too explicit for r/offmychest. So don't suggest I lead some sort of double life, indulging my fantasies in secret. I HATE keeping secrets. My fantasies are all intrinsically about NOT keeping secrets. My sole turn-on is being OPENLY, TOTALLY UNASHAMEDLY sexy without fear, uneasiness, or retribution. I hate that I can't even tell my husband what has turned me on when he asks "how was your day?"  I'm guess I'm hardwired to desire permission for what I'm feeling, and while I truly love my life, that permission is not part of it. So I just spend my time secretly getting off to other, more libertine women's sex lives under a cloud of longing.

Did anyone else experience hiccups after receiving the vaccine? I got my first Pfizer shot 3 weeks ago and I had hiccups at least 3 or 4 times a day for over a week. It just stopped a few days ago. Wondering if it’s a side effect of the shot that others have experienced?

Hi All, hope everyone is coping well despite the ongoing pandemic (I hope it is ok to post this here - happy for it to be removed if not). I am a member of a large international survey project looking at the impact of COVID-19 on the entire population of countries, including people in Wales (and the Rhondda valleys!). The project involves almost 200 investigators in more than 35 countries and has been endorsed by multiple national and international professional organizations and ethical approval has also been obtained from the University of Southampton (for the UK side of the project) and from Aberystwyth University (for the Welsh side of the project specifically). The COH-FIT project aims to identify risk and protective factors that will inform prevention and intervention programs for the COVID-19 pandemic and should other pandemics occur in the future. We are hoping if anyone is kind enough to spend just about 30mins on this survey - we will be so grateful to you. The findings will be of huge importance in improving our understanding of the impact of the pandemic and how to cope with it. Here's more info about the project: [https://www.coh-fit.com/](https://www.coh-fit.com/) and the survey (Diolch yn fawr!): [https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D](https://redcap.neuroscienze.unipd.it/surveys/?s=XHPATW473D)

Hey.  Check the sticked post above if you don't know what is going on.  The curfew has just been lifted and a lot of us will be going back to the office by the end of June or summer -- things are heading back to normal.  I am allowing a grace period for some of the topics, I have a feeling (wish) that some closed places will reopen and others will reinstate their happy hours.  For now, let's talk about the best new places that have opened during the pandemic.  It can be anything -- just make sure you think it's the best.   If you want to suggest or comment on our other megathread/wiki ideas, here is the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskNYC/comments/nh23pq/new_york_is_healing_baby_lets_update_the/).

I'm 14, I have autism, and I've never gotten a shot without crying. Until today! When I got my first covid shot a few minutes ago, I was more happy than scared. First dose done!

Edit: I briefly informed my GP back in March but without any proof.  Hi all, dutch here but born (early 90s) and grew abroad and moved in NL couple years ago. I heard everyone with pre-existing condition like mine got invited for a vaccine but I haven’t yet. I was wondering if I should make someone aware of this in order to get vaccinated. All comments welcome.  Thanks in advance!

[Safety graphics](https://www.riotcolor.com/school-graphics-covid-19/)   As schools and educational spaces reopen amid COVID-19, they must be prepared to make significant changes to their facilities to create a safe environment for everyone. Every school has specialized requirements and unique operational needs, so it’s important to adapt a strategic approach as they reopen and prepare for the arrival of students, staff, and visitors.  Keeping your facility healthy and safe while educating students is crucial to preventing the spread of COVID-19. This 5-Step Assessment Guide will help you to critically evaluate your school, identify areas that need attention, establish safety protocols and minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.  &amp;#x200B;  [Covid-19 graphics](https://preview.redd.it/tnvnqq0ywn271.png?width=4289&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b45102b72a5814dc76a9703d6015dccb197eff6f)

I might be willing to take the CoronaVac because it's based on traditional vaccine technology based on an inactivated form of the virus. However this one isn't available in the US, and I see no indication it will ever be available in the US.

Hi! TL; DR I got my first dose of Moderna without TAJ and without appointment. If anyone in the same situation has been able to get their immunity card, please share how!   I want to make this as clear as possible, in case someone is in a similar situation, so bear with me, cause this might be a little long.  For context, my partner is a non EU citizen and non permanent resident with a TAJ number,  I am also a non EU citizen, non permanent resident but I don’t have TAJ.   I went with him to his first appointment and he asked if it would be possible to get my first shot and after a few hiccups, I was finally able to get a shot of Moderna as well.   This was at our local clinic, in the second district BUT I don’t think they are vaccinating people that do not live in the area cause they did check our documents several times (passport, residence cards and the paper address card as well).  I’d say be prepared to wait cause we spent almost 2 hours and a half. I think it was just our luck cause there was another couple (also foreigners, one with TAJ and one without) that were done in just 45 minutes but they were sent to a different area.    I also just read on Facebook that some folks were able to get their first shot at an 8th district hospital, earlier today.    Best of luck to everyone out there who wants to get it!

My friend suggested to me that I take benedryl an hour before the vaccine to avoid any potential allergic reaction. She says she did this. I get my vaccine today and I’m wondering if there is any harm in doing this? Would it make the vaccine ineffective? I heard you shouldn’t take Tylenol before the vaccine, but you can take it after.

It confuses me. Normally we wait two weeks between stages but it’s worded in a way that we just have to wait until 2 weeks after we hit 70% vaccinated

Any guesses/ideas/insider info around when we can expect to be able to travel again by plane to/from Toronto without having to use loopholes to avoid the [quarantine hotel fees](https://globalnews.ca/news/7901855/covid-hotel-quarantine-mandatory-lifted/)?  Like many, many people in Toronto I haven't been able to see my family (in the southwestern US) since before the pandemic hit early last year. The first grandchild in the family was born last August and at this rate she'll be over a year old before I can meet her. And my situation isn't even that tough - so many families are deeply impacted by the inability to drive across the border and the lack of affordability of air travel with the quarantine fees.  * Both the [US](https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1596?language=en_US) and [Canadian](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/border) gov't websites say that the border is closed to driving for non-essential purposes, and I don't have a car, so I haven't been able to drive to see them. That being said, I've heard many secondhand stories about folks that have easily driven across. How?? * [Walking across the bridge in Niagara Falls](https://globalnews.ca/news/7901855/covid-hotel-quarantine-mandatory-lifted/) seems like a ridiculous stunt and not one I'm willing to bet will work out in my favour if I tried. And again, without a car the trip looks like: GO train to Niagara Falls, cab to the border, walk across the bridge, cab to an airport or car rental place - there are so many ways that this could fail and it's really risky if you can't just hop in the car and drive home.  When can we see our families again? When is this going to end?

How long do you personally keep new birds in quarantine for? I know the recommended time is 1 month, but I usually do 2 weeks if the bird is extremely active and lively and no negative visible signs at all.

"Everyone get vaccinated", "to save yourself from this disease, get vaccinated", "largest vaccination drive"  **but how?**  I have been trying to book a vaccination slot since 3 days on the CoWin site but all my efforts are failing tremendously.   Having tried everything from keeping my phone in a general profile to trying all the bot-messaging services, to having joined several groups which notify about vaccination slots, everything is unsuccessful.  I don't really understand as to how should one get vaccinated if there are no slots available at all. I have tried logging in to the site approximately 20 to 30 times since yesterday but there are no slots available at all. Everytime I open the site I see all the slots are booked. How is that even possible?!  I understand that the rate of production is not quite par with the population of our country but if you see the big picture, you will realise that most of the rural areas and people who are not tech-savvy are not using the site for their bookings (which is a huge inconsideration from the government as they should have also thought about them when creating this server). Trust me, I have tried calling the helpline number several times but it does not work. Also, now they have changed the user-interface which is making it more difficult to figure out the number of slots available.  There have been several rumors regarding this, that the slots are being booked by certain bots but my question is why? and for whom?   It is very difficult for the people to be online continuously to book a slot.  If we the common people of India do not get any slots for vaccination, how does one expect to become a covid-free country?(which as of now seems like a pretty distant dream)  I would like to apologise if I have offended anyone through this post. Also this is coming from a common man just like you and I am sure that a lot of you have also faced this diifficulty.

Would a 10mg bridge be beneficial at all? Or should I stick with to nutrabol at a lower dosage?

So, I'm from EU and did not return to the UK for the 2020/21 year due to the pandemic. As I was quite naive still after the first wave subsided, I booked a room for the entire year and was required to pay my rent in three instalments, which included all the bills. In September, I wasn't able to return (obviously), and since the situation didn't get any better until spring, I kept pushing my return date back until I knew for sure I wouldn't be returning before September 2021.  This means that I paid for the entire year without ever actually staying there, only used it to store my belongings. Of course it's a great loss of money but since the room and rent and location were all really great, I'm not complaining too much.  That said, I've been wondering if I perhaps have a right to ask some of the money back or at least get some summer months off, considering I didn't use any water or electricity or equipment etc. I don't want to come off as rude (the landlord agency is always very friendly and forthcoming and I wouldn't want to offend them) so I was hoping if anyone had more knowledge about such situations or simply some good advice on what to do. We have talked about my keeping the room for one more year but I've been too shy to even propose anything in terms of "cash back".  Thanks in advance x

I just got started on medicine last Friday and so far have been taking 5mg a day. I was curious - do you guys take multiple doses a day? My doctor didn't mention it, just that I could go up to taking 10mg and then 15mg if it's not working as I expect.   This is my second day working a full day on meds and I wanted to know if people typically take another one after an energy dip in the middle of the day?

I’m not saying it was necessarily planned like the prison experiment (not saying it wasn’t either), but it has resulted in flagrant misuse and abuse of power by anyone that has it or thinks they have it. That’s from politicians to scientists to people wearing masks or not wearing them on the streets. People have used this as an opportunity to dictate to others what they believe and in some cases in a criminal manner.  ——  Side note:  There has also been a massive transfer of wealth. The question that needs to be asked is who is making the money from this pandemic and then we need to verify their public and private stance on the situation.

Hello fellow vaccinated people. So, I was given the option last thursday at the VA to get the covid shot, and I chose the one time only shot. The next two days, I had chills, headache, bodyaches, the whole works. Today I still feel crummy and I'm having the runs like never before... I mean the kind that you think you are just gonna sneeze? No. You are gonna shit your pants. Like, I am sick. It's nothing I ate since my appetite has been almost zero since friday, and my whole family ate the same food and are not sick.  &amp;#x200B;  I guess my question is... Is this from the shot? Is it normal to feel sick 5 days after the shot?

I am 20 years old. I spent most of my pre-teen and teen years depressed. It was almost comical how miserable I used to be. I would wake up every day with an intense feeling of dread, despaired by the fact that I would once again need to live my life. I felt alone and unloved, and in truth I could hardly tolerate any of the people I had around me. I think most of them just kind of saw the whole thing as a bit of a joke, and I guess I contributed to that with my self-deprecating humor.   Things got better. I started taking meds and went to uni. It took a while, but I regained my self-confidence, particularly through studying. I excelled as a student and I enjoyed making an effort to learn. I met a really special girl and I fell in love. This was in 2019, and I was finally content with pretty much every aspect of my life. I was ambitious, passionate and hard-working. I ended my treatment, as I felt I no longer needed the meds.  Then the pandemic came around. I had to move back in with my parents, hours away from my uni, my girlfriend and my friends. I haven't seen any of my friends in over a year and I've only spent some of my break periods with my girlfriend. At first, I tried to see the pandemic as an opportunity to focus on preparing for grad school admissions, trying to guarantee my future for when things return to normal.  I ended up losing contact with pretty much everyone I knew, with the notable exception of my girlfriend, although things soon became very difficult for us as well.   Fast-forward a year, and I don't feel like anything in my life makes sense anymore. I've kept my grades up so far, but I no longer see much of a point. The future is no longer bright and hopeful, but rather a source of constant anxiety, with the lingering threat of failure. My motivation is drained and I notice I have brain fog whenever I attempt to focus on anything for very long. I'm very irritable, I never smile with my family and I prefer to stay alone in my room. There's nothing distracting me from studying as much as I would like, and I don't play videogames or chat with friends or anything like that. I just can't feel motivated anymore and I'm constantly lethargic. It's been like this for months. My relationship with my girlfriend has had some issues as well, as we've struggled to maintain any semblance of intimacy in long-distance. I love her very much and I'm lucky to have her, but in my introspection and shame, I've begun to push her away.  So I recently realized that much of what I'm feeling is similar to what I felt when I was depressed, although some of the darker thoughts haven't been as present as they were before. I've come to realize that that golden period of my life, in 2019, wasn't me finally becoming the person that I was supposed to be, unshackled by depression. It was a period of exception to the rule of melancholy that has dictated most of my life. I feel like a fool for believing that I had escaped somehow, that I had matured beyond my adolescent misery. I think I need the meds again. Maybe I'll always need them.

TL/DR: I believe there is a coming wave of Exmo’s coming that will find themselves “out” because of being “ultra-conservative/anti-vaxx”. Where are they headed?  I believe there are mini- or major-waves that come in the Church. For example, when the Church announced the Exclusion Policy, or when they so openly supported Proposition 8. There are groups of Exmo’s that will say, (for example) the Exclusion Policy started me out, or was a TON of weight on my shelf, or was the final push I needed to tell myself I was “out”. So, let’s think of these groups that point to certain issues and say they are part of that “wave” as a demographic. A current wave, for example, is washing through related to the general cohesion of Morridor around Trump, voting conspiracy, Covid response, etc... and saying, “Huh, this doesn’t look right and I’m out.” We’re already seeing this demographic post here.   I also believe there is another demographic headed toward “apostasy”. The fringe, far right wing, ultra-orthodox group in the Church, the DezNatters and sympathizers (they love Ezra Taft Benson) have been very open with expressing doubt or frustration at the Brethren for “masking up” or getting the vaccine. Many, many members are comfortable saying they were talking as men in doing so. The numbers in Morridor are very high, and these are the members that do everything for the church.  Anyway, I think it logically follows that at least some percentage of this demographic is going to “apostatize”. I am talking, specifically, of the demographic that will point to masking up and closing for Covid as a sign that the Church had lost its way, had gotten soft.   Where are they headed? Do many of them actually get “out”, or do they just head deeper “in” with a group more fundamental? Is Ammon Bundy (Et al..) going to start a “splinter group” that they find themselves in and they are more Fundamental than ever? Or, do they end up realizing the false narrative the Church is founded on and end up completely out like a lot of us? Some to one and some to the other? Is there enough cohesion among this group that they will try to organize some new wing or faction?

Hi all!  I am a current General Manager at 2 bars and due to COVID I had no other option but to keep my job after graduating college in 2019. I am 24 years old and as a general manager have been working over 60 hours a week with absolutely no benefits and my mental and physical health has declined to a very poor level due to me having to hold the company on my shoulders and being the only person who wants the best for both employees and consumers.   I took the position as general manager because my predecessor quit and due to how much I care about everyone at my job I didn't want anyone to suffer through bad management or see anyone be screwed over. Now, I have realized that I no longer have a viable lifestyle, given all I have time to do is work and sleep. I have given up time that helped me stay on track with my health, such as an hour of running or quality time with family and friends because I simply don't have the time of day since Mon-Thu I work from 3PM-3AM and Fri-Sun from 10AM-3AM the next morning.  I've applied to over 150 different jobs within my field of study and outside my field of study and have not been able to land any offers, and only 3 interviews. I truly don't know what to do anymore and would appreciate as much help as possible. I have experience in management, clinical research and data analysis. I studied sociology with a minor in public health. I am dedicated, organized and work hard to reach great outcomes. I always put my best foot forward no matter the situation. I have continued my current job due to financial need, but also because I don't give up no matter how hard the situation, but at this point its more than just a hard situation its a situation thats eating me alive. I'm not picky when it comes to being in an office, working from home, getting into a physically rigorous job or even relocating, as long as the compensation matches the job and I don't go into a similar situation I am in.  Thank you all. I know you help out of the kindness of your hearts and any help even if its one single advice such as a change of a single word on my resume or a potential job opening would be appreciated to the greatest of extents.   &amp;#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/vsgqyn954o271.png?width=1214&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63676133aa1cff2ae909cceeed09c3d279bd033b

I read previous posts but just want to make sure I understand correctly:  1/ if I’m traveling from mainland US to any Hawaiian island, I need to do the approved covid test before departure.  2/ traveling inter-island, you need *another* covid test for all islands besides Oahu. So if I went Mainland to Oahu to Big Island to Maui, I’d need three covid tests total, but if I went Mainland to Maui to Oahu, I’d only need one test.  3/ Being fully vaccinated outside of Hawaii doesn’t change any of this   4/ there’s no plans to change this in the near future.  5/ What if I fly from mainland US to HNL airport and immediately change planes to go to Maui? Do I still need 2 tests in that scenario?   Let me know if I got anything wrong! Thanks.

I'm currently working on a world where a nanovirus (synthetic pathogen) is spreading across the world and turning people into robots that act violently if provoked.  The virus is transmitted by skin contact with infected people, contact with infected body fluids, and is also airborne.  The government has issued a shelter-in-place order and is telling the public to have survival supplies readily available.  This is a list of what I have so far:  * Food * Water * Batteries * First aid kit * At least 1 working phone * At least 1 firearm with corresponding ammunition in case one of the machines get in  Is there anything else I need to include? I likely forgot a few obvious things because I'm an oaf with a degree in buffoonery, but if I didn't then yey.

Record low hospitalizations. 10%+ drop in ICU cases.  The case numbers may increase in the coming days because of delays from the holiday weekend, but the drop in hospitalizations should be "real".  Vaccinations have dropped off a cliff, but will likely pick back up in the coming days.

My mum won't allow me to get vaccinated with any vaccine ever since I was diagnosed as she is extremely afraid of the side effects of the specific vaccine and focuses on it more than the benefits of being vaccinated. However I feel that its important for me to get vaccinated with a Covid-19 vaccine soon. Can anyone who has epilepsy and has already been vaccinated with the PFizer BioNTech vaccine tell me if there are any severe side effects from it?

Predictions are always being made of when we will hit certain vaccine milestones, but they're always based on our current vaccine administration rate, rather than by looking at what our supply will actually be. We've been pretty good at quickly administering all the vaccines we procure, so I feel like the delivery schedule is what really matters when it comes to predicting when we'll hit 75% fully vaxed, for example.  The issue is that the vaccine schedule is constantly changing. I've been trying to find a place to monitor an up-to-date schedule for upcoming vaccine deliveries but I'm coming up dry. Wondering if anyone has found anything or if anyone has put one together that I'm not seeing.  Thank you!!

I got back from college recently. What a first year man, senior year of high school dominated by covid, no graduation/prom, then freshman year dominated by covid too. What a time lol. And to be clear, I know I don't have even close to the worst of it, but imma complain still.  On top of covid and the transition to college i bad to deal with qanon cult stuff at home. How I shouldn't get the vaccine, how we should prep for what's coming, etc.  Well guess what, at college, I got the vaccine! And my qmom doesn't know. My dad does, and he's a covid skeptic, but he can keep his mouth shut. I just sorry for my siblings

I was asked to book my 2nd Pfizer dose which I did. Sadly though while I was hoping to get a Friday so I can recoup over the weekend, but spots are limited and so I got a Wednesday.  The thing is I'm working Thurs and Fri, and with my work we're short-staffed, so if I were to ask for time off it should be in advance so it can be planned around.  What's been most people's reaction to the 2nd dose? Did you need one or two days to recover or was it a case of taking a Tylenol and power through the day? This will help me figure out what (if anything) I should do to plan.  TIA

Lateral flow device testing is included under this pillar  Pillars 1 and 2 are swab tests targeted at those who are sick and with symptoms. They look for the presence of the virus itself. Pillar 1 and 2 tests are only counted when processed. There is no longer a separate 'made available' number.  * pillar 3: serology testing to show if people have antibodies from having had coronavirus  Pillar 3 tests are designed to identify if a person has antibodies in their system, which means that they have had coronavirus at some point, but they do not test for the presence of the virus itself (as in pillars 1 and 2). Tests in pillar 3 are counted when they are processed by a lab.  This pillar does not report people tested or positive cases because tests are anonymised before being sent to a lab. Positive cases for pillar 3 are different to pillars 1 and 2 so should not be classed together.  * Pillar 4:  Surveillance testing – antibody serology and PCR swab testing for national surveillance supported by PHE, ONS, Biobank, universities and other partners to learn more about the prevalence and spread of the virus and for other testing research purposes, for example on the accuracy and ease of use of home testing  Testing in pillar 4 is designed to understand the spread of the virus and the reliability of different testing methods.  As with the other pillars, pillar 4 tests are counted when they are processed by a lab.  People testing positive from Pillar 4 PCR swab tests are now included in the positive cases figure. Previously this was not possible to due the inability to deduplicate individuals.  **Lateral flow device tests**  Lateral flow device tests test for the presence of COVID-19 and are swab tests that give results in less than an hour, without needing to go to a laboratory. Lateral flow device tests have been used in trials of mass testing in schools, universities and care homes, and have been available for those who live or work in Liverpool for a two-week period from 6 November 2020. Data for these tests include confirmed positive, negative or void lateral flow device test results and may include multiple tests for an individual person.  &gt; &gt; ----- &gt;  Data is provided by

This is my recap of today's announcement, along with previously announced changes. [Berlin.de](https://Berlin.de) reports 50% of the info across multiple pages. Newspapers report 95% of the info. If you combine them all, you get this list. Just the changes in a nice bullet list, no bullshit.  **I will not update this post. It's copied and pasted from** [this page](https://allaboutberlin.com/guides/coronavirus)**, which does get updated.**  \---------  ## Changes on June 11  * **Hotels** and pensions can reopen for tourists[1](https://www.rbb24.de/politik/thema/corona/beitraege/2021/06/berlin-senat-corona-lockerungen-gastronomie-schulen-kontakte.html), [2](https://www.berlin.de/tourismus/nachrichten/6634465-1721038-hotels-oeffnen-ab-dem-11-juni-fuer-touri.html).

Hello all,  the title says it all. We don't want to have a wedding that causes any misery and wanted to find a reasonable or polite way to request that folks attempt to vaccinate before they attend for their own safety and that of others. If they don't, we might request that they wear a mask and take extra safety measures (is this reasonable? and any tips for how to suggest this?) It's going to be a gathering of old and young and we don't want anyone to fall ill because of our special day.   I know a lot will reopen this fall, but I worry that not enough people will be vaccinated by then to achieve herd immunity.  any tips will help!

So apparently my girl is studying dental sciences (she is an intern) in a hospital/college. They just out of the blue mandated covid vaccines. Anyone who has any legal insight into it ?   Can they mandate a potentially harmful drug onto people ? The government hasn’t mandated it yet and I don’t think they can ... Any thoughts on how to get out of this shit ?  P.S - I am from India and we’re both anti experimental vaccines.

I'm guessing it's based off strength of kratom over anything else, but I notice with almost any strain after about 4.5 g's at one time it's not gonna feel any nicer, just more wobbly. By this I mean, when does kratom start blocking opiate receptors from itself.

I returned to the workforce in mid-April (I had to) and everyone here has either been vaccinated before I came or recently.   I suffer from migraines but prior to my return to work, it was only approximately one or two per month. Since I’ve returned I’ve had 5 in the last 6 weeks. This is not normal for me.  Also, I’m noticing premenstrual syndrome is BAD. High anxiety, wicked mood swings. Today all I feel like doing is bawling.   The only things that have changed is I’m forced to wear a mask more often (it is not optional if I want to work) and I’m around vaccinated people daily.  Anyone else experience anything similar?

I don’t know what to do. Where I live, it’s literally mandatory to get the vaccine now. I have no choice. I can’t attend classes, get my license, go to grocery stores, malls, pharmacies (yes pharmacies) or travel. I don’t have access to pretty much anything anymore. I get the vaccine in a couple of days and was wondering if there are any detox or methods to cleanse my system of it. Is there anything that I can do at all? I don’t want this thing in my system.

I personally know of a few people who have taken one shot or two shots of the Pzifer vaccine. Most of these people do not seem to have experienced any ill side effects. The only side effects I can confirm until now - my uncle reported feeling lethargic after his first shot, and my aunt became allergic to oranges shortly after taking her first shot. Her face swelled up really bad, and emergency services were called.  Something I have noticed on the internet is that various people stick magnets to their arm which really freaks me out. Not sure if this is a hoax or just a natural side effect of some of the covid-19 vaccines.  Thanks in advance

**Summary:**  Very minor side effects for both doses: Almost-headaches that were remedied with a single tylenol, increased tiredness, mild aches, wanting more snacks. Needle barely hurt (10x better than getting a blood draw). Arm soreness each time was mild-moderate and went away after a day. No changed in period noticed so far.  **Prep work:** I drank a ton of electrolytes (liquidIV). I've also been supplementing with vitamin C and  D+k2 for months now. I am not sure if that impacted anything but wanted to mention it. Also, I had a decent bit of anxiety regarding side effects so to alleviate that I prepared for the worst which made me feel a bit better.  Some things I did to prepare:  * I was worried about bleeding issues (I get nosebleeds and bruise easily) and blood clots so I went to my doctor and we ordered some labs to double check everything (CBC, Iron, Ferritin, Clotting disorders, protein c, cmp, and I threw in a vitamin D check to see how my supplementation was going.  This made me feel more proactive, and talking to my dr calmed my nerves a bit too. Lab results were good, though I discovered I was a little low on Ferritin. * I saw a decent amount of reports regarding changes in women's periods so I bought some period underwear just in case I need extra backup. I wore those to bed the night(s) after getting the shot just in case it triggered an early period while I slept (I had read about this happening). It made me feel better to know I was prepared in that way too. Also, it doesn't hurt to have those around anyway. * The above two methods involve spending money and using health insurance which I know isn't an option for everyone. But, another thing I did to prep for dose 2 is to make a huge batch of chicken soup. This is very economical, especially if you use a whole chicken to make it instead of buying broth + chicken separately.  Feeling prepared with comfort food helped me feel less anxious too. What you don't eat you can freeze and use later. * Reading this sub was both good and bad. It helped me identify what to be ready for. But it also psyched me out a bit. So, if you need to stop reading, do that. I know it can be hard to know what's real or not sometimes. When that happens - look at the numbers. How many users are in this sub? Ok. Now how many reports are negative? And how many negative reports are there per day? Now compare that to the millions of doses that have already gone out. Even if you 10x the negative reports you see, it is still a small fraction of doses gone out. Also, don't just rely on the internet. Ask people around you that you know in real life.   **Side effects detail:**  Dose 1: The day-of I didn't really feel any negative side effects at all. I barely felt the needle, I could kind of tell that "something" was happening in my body but that was kind of it. The next morning my arm felt sore, it reminded me of the sore you feel if you sleep the wrong way. The soreness went away by the next day. I had some extra tiredness on day 2 and a headache that started to appear but went away after taking a single tylenol. Dose 1 was 1 week before my period was due and it arrived on time without any changes.  Dose 2: Day-of was similar to the first dose. The nurse did tell me that I could take tylenol or ibuprofen if I needed to. I felt fine, but was anticipating being knocked out on day 2.  Day 2 arrives and is fairly uneventful. I was more tired this time, and I spent the day taking it easy and alternating between the couch, bed, and mass effect. By the evening I did have some joint/muscle aches that lasted a few hours, so I took an Aleve before bed just to make sure I got a full night's sleep.  Day 3 I felt pretty much back to normal, except for the tiredness. I remember walking to a local coffeeshop and feeling a bit more tired and breathing heavier than usual. Dose 2 was about 2 weeks before my period is due and I haven't noticed any changes yet.  I am now 5 days out from the second dose and feel pretty much back to normal. I haven't tried exerting myself yet to see how tired I get though. Overall, a pretty mild experience and glad I got it :) I'm looking forward to being able to hang out with my friend who is immunocompromised and her daughter who can't get vaccinated due to allergies. And my other friend who was a smoker for 30 years. And visiting the shop that's partially staffed by people with down's syndrome (they recently just opened back up).  I hope this has been helpful.

Hey!  Hope everyone is having a great day so far;  I have some concerns about COVID-19 in relation to blood. It seems there are quite a few results on google when I search up COVID-19 in relation to blood + blood thinners but I don't see any in relation to the persons blood actually seeming less viscous after the shot/having a positive test result for COVID-19.  I've noticed my (23f) blood runs quicker and doesn't clot quite as fast (after the vaccine, Pfizer x2 doses april/may) as it used to and my girlfriend has a friend (also 23f, had COVID-19 march 2020) who lost her sense of smell, regained it, but her cuts don't heal as fast or quite the same.  For me, my cuts will clot after maybe 1hr of steady bleeding (I never used to be a bleeder) and I've noticed my blood runs thinner than before. Any scabs of mine used to heal up ASAP but I've now had a scab on my foot for 2 weeks that hasn't made any real progress and keeps getting ripped open by the smallest of movements/accidental nudges.  I'm unaware of how my girlfriends friends body was in terms of healing before but now it seems her cuts will bleed for nearly 1 hour as well (we're talking small cuts, smaller than the size of the dime) and scars will occur from just about any minor cut.      If anyone has any links to any academic papers or studies that are related to blood in relation to COVID-19 that they feel hold weight please drop them in the comments below.   Also, my girlfriend and I have been going to many neurologists in reference to COVID-19 and having her get brain scans and testing out adult-onset ADD due to COVID-19 (as well as trying different ADD medications - those have helped her get her sense of smell back, a slow drip, after 13 months of no sense of smell at all) so if anyone has any academic papers in reference to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome or ADD and COVID-19 please do post a comment with those links/titles as well.

Hello, I want to visit my grandparents living in Russia, but the actual of getting there is pretty confusing. I know that I'll need a Visa and PCR test.  But the pcr test part is confusing. I thought that you can take one at Frankfurt airport for like 20€ and be done with it, but the travel agency said, that I need to take one in Mannheim. And I would also need to take one in Mineralniye Wody.   Has anybody experience with the topic and could help me out?

Our mass vaccination sites (Oregon Convention Center/OHSU at the Airport) are closing down.  **IF YOU NEED A FIRST SHOT OF PFIZER/MODERNA**  Your options are now to go to a pharmacy (Walgreens, Fred Meyer, etc). While most of these places don't show appointments for many weeks, most offer walk ins and almost all have spare doses at the end of the day. It is now reasonable to call the pharmacy directly to ask if they can fit you in. Generally, in PDX proper, Walgreens offer Pfizer and Walmart/Safeway offer Moderna, but this is not always true.  [https://www.vaccines.gov/](https://www.vaccines.gov/) can give you some better info. Remember, 12-18 year olds can ONLY get Pfizer.  **IF YOU NEED A SECOND SHOT OF PFIZER/MODERNA**  You can still go to [Oregon Convention Center](https://all4oregon.org/) or [OHSU at the Airport](https://www.ohsu.edu/health/vaccine-scheduling-jhse) for second doses of Pfizer (OCC) or Pfizer and Moderna (OHSU at the Airport), but only until June 19th. While you don't need an appointment, its helpful to check the sites mostly to see what days they're open. OHSU at the airport is now the only drive thru site in PDX. The CDC rules last month that ALL vaccination locations MUST give you a second dose even if you got your first dose someplace else. You do not need to get your second dose in the same place.  [LeCare Pharmacy](https://www.lecarepharmacy.com/) is offering walk in appointments for all three vaccines.  **If you'd like the One Shot Johnson &amp; Johnson Vaccine**  OCC will offer this on specific days, as will OHSU. Check the links provided for info on what days. Rite Aids offer the J and J shot as a walk in, but are only open for vaccines Tues-Sat.  **Other Options**  Smaller "pop up" clinics are always opening - [this site](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics) lists them, and gives you specifics about what is offered, when and how to get it.  **Special Notes for 12-18 Year Olds**  In Oregon, citizens 15 years and over have medical sovereignty. This means they should not need parental permission to receive a vaccine. But in reality, many corporate chains (Walgreens/Kroger, possibly others) have policies that do not allow pharmacists to honor Oregon law. If you are a 15-17 yr old and want to be vaccinated, you'll want to go to one of the [Multnomah County sponsored clinics](https://www.multco.us/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/upcoming-covid-19-vaccination-clinics), listed here, or Safeway, Albertsons or Sav-On or LeCare. [Click here](https://getvaccinated.oregon.gov/#/locator) for more help.  **If you are undocumented**  LeCare Pharmacy asks for an ID, but if you tell them you do not have one, they simply ask you to print out your name and vaccinate you anyways. There is no onsite security/police presence, although there might be at the Trader Joes around the corner, just FYI. If this feels like the right situation for you and you need a ride/advocate, I will take you.   **If you need help, are scared, need special accommodations, have questions, need a ride**  I'm a PDX local and I'm really happy to help. Whether that's driving you, helping you find the vaccine you want, answering questions about your concerns, or even going with you and advocating for you or holding your hand, or doing whatever you need to help create an environment you feel safe in. I'll work to make it happen. Just send me a chat or message.

Today, the president of the Robert-Koch-Institut (RKI) (you can compare it to the CDC or NHS),  Lothar Wieler said the following: "Um  auf Maßnahmen verzichten zu können, müssen mehr als 80 Prozent  vollständig geimpft sein." which translates as "To be able to forego any measures, more than 80 percent must be fully vaccinated". So there will never be again a life where you are allowed to show your face, no more sold out football stadiums, no more large concerts (4 of the bigger events in Germany were already cancelled for this year) or any other sort of a normal, social, life. Realistically there is no chance to get 80 percent of the population vaccinated.  Now you may say: But there will be elections this year in Germany! Yes. But the biggest new-normal-supporting party, who even want more and more measures, are gaining the biggest wins, the Greens. So say Goodbye to the life you had before 2020, it will never come back to Germany. Can't wait to leave this country some day, when i have enough money to do so. Sadly it will take a while.

Whenever I take 20mg of Adderall IR in the morning, it usually hits me pretty hard. I’m prescribed to take 20mg twice a day, but sometimes I’ll feel like I only need to take 10mg for my second dose because of how hard the first 20mg hits. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes, after taking a second dose of 10mg, when it hits me, the high feels noticeable “weaker” in the sense that, if I’m still feeling the effects of the 20mg dose a decent amount and then take 10mg, the 20mg high feels as though it has become dulled despite adding 10mg to it, if that makes sense.  So while I know this may be kind of a stupid question, it makes me wonder… regarding the potency of the effects, does the second dose you take only add to the first 20mg dose I take and I’m just maybe overthinking this whole thing, or does it “overwrite” the first 20mg dose; only making it feel like I took 10mg to beging with even though I took a total of 30mg? I hope all of this makes sense. It’s honestly not a huge deal, I’m mainly just asking out of curiosity based on my observations.

Mesmo tendo cormobidade (hipertensão), essa amiga nunca fez isolamento, usa máscara do nariz de fora (quando usa) etc. Então óbvio que, vacinada, os cuidados diminuiram ainda mais. Aí agora, infectada, mantém os mesmos hábitos por estar super leve o Covid.  Ela não seria um transmissor mais perigoso que antes, já que os sintomas estão levíssimos e ela se acha no direito de sair? Ou o fato de estar vacinada e com sintomas leves faz com que as chances de infectar a outros seja menor?

i put on a little bit of weight since the start of quarantine and my mother always seems to make a snide remark about it, even knowing i have very low self-esteem. i could be overthinking things but i feel like she has the most disgusted look on her face when she interacts with me and i try to ignore all of these things but it hurts.  whenever i've expressed my problems regarding my mental health it felt like i was inconveniencing them by even speaking about it. my depression was invalid to them because they had a "harder life" and much rougher upbringing. it took me a lot of courage to express this part of me and it made me feel betrayed, unwanted, and worthless.   i was planning to move out sometime last year and felt like it was a bad time due to the pandemic, and i live in a very expensive city. i graduated college recently and don't really have the means to get on my feet so it's extremely hard to deal with.  sorry if this doesn't happen to fit this sub. i've never written openly about my problems in such a way and just wanted a way to express myself and get insight from others who have experienced similar things.   thank you for reading

I tested negative for covid 19 early January, after a two week infection that was honestly quite uneventful. A little fever, a little shortness of breath. Now, my breathing problems are suddenly getting worse. Hospitals here are swamped with active cases and won't give me the time of day. I just want to understand what's happening to my body. It gets harder to breathe at night, and it's hard to inhale, easy to exhale, easier to breathe through my mouth and hard to breathe through my nose. If you know something about this please help.

Hi all,   I’m wondering how am I supposed to know when or what test I should be signing up for if I’m still awaiting results? I’d like to either take LVL II again ASAP or if I passed, lvl III In February. However, because I was originally slated to test lvl II June 2020 and it was delayed twice due to COVID, will the CFAI allow me to sign up and retake these tests in a closer date than previously? (Ie waiting a full year)  I’ve tried calling CFAI on two different numbers they list online and they’re both out of service for me at this time. I see we don’t even receive the results for 6-8 weeks after the CBT exam (which is mind blowing to me, I thought we’d get them back in a week) and the November test schedule is already on a more expensive tier. That doesn’t seem very fair for us who had our tests deferred. Does anyone have any information about this scenario?

Hi people!  I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I'm just a little lost about the topic is all. I've not really been able to find out if there are any walk-in vaccination centres at the moment and where to get updates about it. I don't really know if there's a specific way this stuff works in the UK since I only moved here late last year so I'm still getting used to how things work. I've tried to find info online but I've seen different people say different things. Are there any +18 walk-in vaccination centres in Manchester at the moment and if not is there some way I can keep myself updated on the matter? Thanks in advance!

  TL:DR:  IU won't require vaccine information to be collected /  uploaded  for the COVID19 experimental/emergency use vaccine, but does request everyone to attest that they have either had a vaccine or have a medical or religious exemption.          #       Indiana University has ~~(talked to our lawyers)~~  released new   health and safety guidance for the upcoming fall semester that will be         effective beginning Aug. 1. This guidance includes details on the         COVID-19 vaccine requirement for all students, faculty and staff, as         well as lifting most restrictions on masking and physical  distancing.     ## Requesting a vaccine exemption     IU has made adjustments to its vaccine         verification and exemption process after receiving ~~(threats of lawsuits)~~ feedback from students, parents, faculty and staff. A form for requesting vaccination         exemption for medical or religious reasons, or an online exemption for         those who will not be present on or near a campus, will be available         June 2.         ## Certifying vaccine status  Those who have received the COVID-19         vaccine will no longer be required to upload documentation ~~(since requiring so is against state law)~~ , but will         instead be able to certify their status as part of a simple attestation ~~(honor system)~~         form available  starting June 2. Details of an incentive program for         those who upload vaccine documentation will be announced soon.      ## Masks and physical distancing     Wearing a mask on campus will be         optional for those who are fully vaccinated. Those who are exempt from         the vaccine requirement or in the process of becoming fully vaccinated         should continue to wear a mask on campus.       Classrooms, labs, housing, dining and other campus facilities will         return to pre-pandemic capacities with no physical distancing         required.     ## COVID-19 testing     Those who are fully vaccinated will         not be required to participate in mitigation testing, but they may be         asked to participate in surveillance testing to monitor for areas of         concern.       Those exempt from the vaccine requirement or in the process of getting         vaccinated will continue to participate in mitigation testing.

So I'm trying to schedule an appointment to receive a COVID19 (Rapid Diagnostic Test) because it's required to enter Hawaii. I have entered all my information to select an appointment slot; however, the website only lets me schedule an appointment up to 3 days in advance. I've tried entering other zip codes around my area (because I thought maybe they're all taken up). Unfortunately, they still only let me schedule an appointment for May 30th at the latest. I would really like to schedule this appointment for June 9th because the government of Hawaii requires that the test be made &gt;72hours of the departure flight (June 11th). Does Walgreens only let you schedule COVID19 tests up to 3 days in advance? Has it always been like this? Is there any way I can schedule my test for June  9th? Thank you.

Tennessee woman who died in February gets letter saying she’s positive for COVID-19.  https://www.wkbn.com/news/national-world/tennessee-woman-who-died-in-february-gets-letter-saying-shes-positive-for-covid-19/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app  NYPD: Man shot by officers later dies of coronavirus🤡 https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/nypd-man-shot-officers-dies-coronavirus-70941694   Car crash victim recorded as Covid Death  https://www.newsweek.com/florida-man-killed-crash-listed-covid-19-death-raising-doubts-over-health-data-1518994  Here’s Another one  https://www.foxnews.com/health/colorado-man-died-alcohol-poisoning-death-classified-coronavirus-report His blood-alcohol content measured in at .55. The legal limit in the state is .08. I didn’t even know it could get that high.  Tens of thousands of coronavirus tests have been double-counted, officials admit https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/tens-thousands-coronavirus-tests-have-double-counted-officials/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app  Chicken wings test positive for Covid-19 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbiQWKAHK3c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app  “The case definition is very simplistic. It means, at the time of death, it was a COVID positive diagnosis. That means, that if you were in hospice and had already been given a few weeks to live, and then you also were found to have COVID, that would be counted as a COVID death. It means, technically even if you died of a clear alternative cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it’s still listed as a COVID death.”  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljpHugKNcoI  Tests weren't even required, as per CDC guidelines.  Also, the big takeaway no one is really even mentioning. The PCR  test does not test for the disease called COVID-19, it allegedly tests for partial genetic code of the virus alleged to cause COVID-19. Just because there may be a virus present, or more accurately when speaking specifically about the PCR test, portions of an alleged viral particle present, that does not mean you have the disease the virus is alleged to cause. Yet that's exactly how cases and deaths are counted. Saying someone has a disease due to partial particles of a virus. Complete insanity.  They shouldn't call it a "COVID test", as it isn't testing for a disease. It isn't even testing for a full, or functioning virus particle. They should call it "a test that could potentially show a positive result for the presence a partial viral particle, or a non functioning viral particle, after a dirty genetic sample has been amplified billions of times".

I'm 29 so I didn't live through the AIDS epidemic. I really knew nothing about it aside from what I'd gleaned from the musical Rent. A few weeks ago, thanks to an article in *Harper's* about a woman who had been a nurse on an AIDS ward in the 80s, I stumbled deeeeeep down an internet rabbit hole reading articles and looking at photos of men who had died from AIDS in the 80s and 90s. Something about that hit me like a ton of bricks: here were all these cute, fun, happy young men with their whole lives ahead of them. They were in their 20s and they went from living the same carefree party lifestyle I live to being ill and decrepit like someone in their 90s. Most of them never even made it to the age I am now. And yet...here I am destroying my body by choice. At 23 these guys were on their deathbed and would have given anything for a chance to live. At 23 I gave myself alcoholic gastritis and I *still* refused to quit drinking despite being in horrible pain nearly every day. Six years later and I still haven't been able to quit for good. Every time I drink I'm *choosing* to poison myself and destroy my perfectly healthy body, and for what? Why would anybody do that? Life is so short.  After trying to quit on and off since 2018 I'm finally done for good. This time I don't feel like I'm giving something up; instead I'm giving myself the gift of health. I'm doing it for myself and I'm doing it for all those young guys who lost their lives before they'd even began. I'm done destroying my body; I'll let fate, or hopefully old age, take care of that one for me.  I will not drink with you today, or ever!!!

*What's wrong with this line of thought:*  Each year flu vaccines are only partially effective because the vaccines can not be made in quantity close enough to real time to fight the specific variants that are most prevalent in the area of vaccine distribution.  Covid variants created via combining existing variants of concern have already begun spreading rapidly, and some vaccines are already ineffective against just the first round of variants of concern.  Some factors that may help determine if we are heading towards a kind of "second pandemic" or not:  • Speed of spread and effectiveness of old vaccines against new variants  • When vaccines are ineffective, ability for new vaccines to be created fast enough to stay ahead of how fast new variants spread  • Total number of dangerous variants, and how rapidly new dangerous variants appear.  Should we be watching out for signs of of a kind of "second pandemic" due to variants existing vaccines are too ineffective against, and new vaccines or strategies that can't keep up with that spread?

Hey y’all, survived my variant reinfection! It was a lot rougher this time and now my long haul is.. different. Might make a different post about that once I know what’s going to stick. Anyway, does anyone have any idea how long I should wait for the vaccine? The US seems to say “when you’re better” and the country I’m currently living in says “after six months” (they want you to use your natural immunity). I thought I remembered seeing something on this topic here, but nothing came up when I searched.

Tried to schedule a home visit with Root-Rooter this weekend. I figured since this going to be in my home, and people in my home are too young to be vaccinated, I'd ask the dispatcher about if the tech coming is vaccinated or not.  They would not answer. I finally had to go back and forth with three people. The final one eventually agreed to call the tech, but complained that figuring this out would take 60 phone calls in order to figure out people's vaccine needs for everyone. I pointed out that millions of people are sick or dead from this virus, compared to that complaining about the mild inconvenience of 60 phone calls is absolute insanity. He expressed sheer indifference at people's deaths, which is not a good image for one's company, for sure.

Boas malta.   Tenho 24 anos e um IMC de 37. Portanto pertenço ao grupo de risco e devia estar na lista para ser vacinado na 2ª fase.

Marcar consulta com o médico de família e dizer "olhe doutor, sou bué gordo, gostava ser vacinado sff"? \*nervous laughter\*     Obrigado malta, um bom bacalhau a todos

Most of the people in my own life that wanted the vaccine got it, and those that I know that didn’t probably won’t any time soon. Is there anywhere that doesn’t want to get it until it’s FDA approved? I see moderna is applying for full FDA approval now which is what sparked my question.

Hello, my name is Sarah and I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, studying under the mentorship of Dr. Charles Benight. I am conducting a study assessing how interpersonal and community-related social interactions influence psychological outcomes associated with stress and adaption in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. You will be asked to complete a series of online self-report questions, and you will have the option to participate in additional surveys in the future. This should take approximately 30 minutes. Participation is entirely voluntary and you have the right to leave the study at any time without penalty. Thank you for your interest in this project!

Hi, I’m just wondering if anyone has had a late or absent period after the first dose of moderna. I am very stressed in general, but have not had sex so I’m sure I’m not pregnant.   I am slightly underweight (31, 5 foot 3, 98 pounds) and have been doing colon cleansing.   I’m not sure if it’s vaccine related or ammenoria. I skipped my period in April and bled super light last month.   I get my second vaccine this week so I wanted to see if I’m normal?  Thanks!

Hej!  Siden det blev muligt i min region, har jeg hver dag skrevet mig på venteliste til en restvaccine. Jeg ved godt, at sandsynligheden for at få én er ret lav, men jeg tager det som et billigere alternativ til at spille lotto. Jeg kender dog ingen, der endnu har fået en vaccine ved at skrive sig på ventelisten, ikke engang folk som ellers burde have den rigtige alder til det.   Derfor synes jeg, at det kunne være interessant at høre, om der er nogen her, der enten har fået en restvaccine selv, kender nogen, der har, eller måske selv er med til at uddele dem? Når ventelisterne overhovedet at komme i brug, før alt er afsat?

Hey fellas,   I only know that one of my friends got vaccinated by registering to the reserve list in Brussels. However, once he got there for vaccination they told him that only astrazeneca  vaccine is available and he cannot choose the vaccination since only leftovers are astrazeneca vaccines for reseve list.  Now I'm in situation that I can register to the reserve list but I don't want to get astrazeneca cuz second shot is after 2 months later which affects my summer plans to visit my country after 1.5 year. On the other hand, I also don't know how long I'd wait for my turn w/o reserve list and which vaccines will be available at that time.  It'd be great if anyone knows how reserve list works and is there any chance to get pfizer/biontech or moderna vaccine?

(I'm a bot) ***** &gt; The decision follows the listing of another vaccine by state-owned Sinopharm, which became the first Covid-19 jab developed by a Chinese company to receive the emergency use listing on May 7.Other vaccines to earn the designation include Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca/University of Oxford, in partnership with vaccine-makers in India and South Korea.  &gt; A WHO strategic advisory group, which provides recommendations for vaccine use but not licensing, recommended the vaccine for adults 18 years and older.  &gt; The two-dose vaccine, which was authorised for emergency use in China last July, has already played an outsize role in global vaccine supply, as low- and middle-income countries including Brazil, Indonesia and the Philippines scramble for access to doses and have increasingly turned to China.  &gt; &amp;quot;We will strengthen our cooperation with global partners, United Nations Children&amp;#039;s Emergency Fund, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and Covax to ensure Sinovac vaccines can enter more countries and play a more important role in containing the Covid-19 pandemic,&amp;quot; he said.  &gt; The institute, which partnered with Sinovac to run Brazil&amp;#039;s phase three clinical trials of CoronaVac, said some 27,000 adults, or 96 per cent of the adult population of Serrana outside Sao Paulo, were given two doses of the inactivated vaccines at a 28-day interval starting mid February.  &gt; Around 1.05 million doses of the Sinovac vaccines have been administered, including some 440,000 people who had received two shots.   ***** [**Summary Source**](https://smmry.com/https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3135677/who-approves-sinovac-biotechs-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use) | [FAQ](http://autotldr.io/ "531785 summaries so far.") | [Feedback](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr "PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.") | *Top* *keywords*: **vaccine**^#1 **Sinovac**^#2 **Doses**^#3 **data**^#4 **more**^#5  Post found in [/r/worldnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/npy312/who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_coronavirus_vaccine/), [/r/Coronavirus](http://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/npycoi/who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_coronavirus_vaccine/), [/r/China](http://np.reddit.com/r/China/comments/npxiz4/who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_covid19_vaccine_for/), [/r/TrendingQuickTVnews](http://np.reddit.com/r/TrendingQuickTVnews/comments/npx89d/who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_covid19_vaccine_for/), [/r/AutoNewspaper](http://np.reddit.com/r/AutoNewspaper/comments/npwra9/world_who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_covid19/) and [/r/SCMPauto](http://np.reddit.com/r/SCMPauto/comments/npw6uw/world_who_approves_sinovac_biotechs_covid19/).  *NOTICE*: This thread is for discussing the submission topic.

I’m a new dasher and also new to city life. One thing I’ve learned very quickly is that after dark, public restrooms are rare as hen’s teeth.   I was dropping food off to a third floor walkup apartment the other night, when halfway up the stairs I had a very sudden, VERY strong need to use the john. I genuinely thought I was gonna shit my pants. I had to do a weird Tin Man walk back to the car, but I made it, and the urgency subsided just enough that I figured I’d be okay to get to my next pickup, which was at 7-11.  They know me in there. I’ve picked up at least one order from them every day for the last few weeks, and I drop in every morning before my day job for cigarettes and a drink. I figured it’d be alright to ask if I could use the bathroom.   And then this grown ass man looked me in the face and said, “number one or number two?”  I asked him if it really made a difference and he said “I can’t let anybody go number two, COVID-19 restrictions. I could maybe make an exception for number one, but...sorry, boss.”  Like...you could have just said no?

 Federal health officials announced the updated guidance during a press briefing on Tuesday, with NACI recommending that a first dose of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine can safely be combined with a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots "unless contraindicated."   \--------------------------  This seems quite surreal to me, given that Zeneca vaccine is not an MRNA 'vaccine' - mixing the 2 technologies doesn't seem like a wise move.  Anyone?

I have a friend who's currently studying at a university in the UK as a foreigner from Indonesia. Her mother is an anti-vaxxer and she thus has not been vaccinated for most common diseases, such as polio or measles. She does not share her mother's opinion though, and our friend group is trying to convince her to see if she can get those vaccines in the UK through the NHS. She is, from what we can tell, a healthy 19 year-old woman who is not immuno-compromised, but we aren't sure. The only vaccine she has gotten that we are sure of is an influenza vaccine that was given to her around 2-3 years ago when she was in high school by (Indonesian) government healthcare workers.  How much can the NHS help her, and is it even possible legally and medically for her to get vaccinated now? What are the requirements to do this, and will she encounter any difficulties? Will there also be a cost to her?  Again, to clarify, she is NOT seeking a COVID-19 vaccine. She is looking to get all the regular vaccines that she should have gotten as a child that her anti-vaxx mother refused to get for her.  Thanks ahead.

Hello, I’m new to this subreddit but acid is something I’m fairly experienced with. However, I had only tripped once alone and it was en experience that really shook me in a bad way during it. That was little over half a year though and I’m curious to trip alone again because my friends have told me it can be a whole new experience. I’m also thinking of tripping at night for the first time because I think the more calm and quiet setting might help with the problems I had last time. Anyways, what would you say is a good dose to do alone but nothing that is too insane or that could put me in a bad state (most I’ve done is three and a half). Also if you have any important advice on general preparation for tripping alone/at night, including maybe the best time to drop and some ways to make sleep a little easier for me, please feel free to talk about that as well! Thank you, and happy tripping!

On day three (for me personally) the muscles pain I had in my arm went away in the early morning but once the evening came I started to get extreme muscles pains around my abdomen then spent the rest of the night trowing up and falling in and out of consciousness.   I was wondering if anyone had a similar reaction 🤔

There's news about the variant from Vietnam but after hearing that it's a mix between the British and Indian variants, which the vaccines can kill, I hope that our efforts to keep vaccinate will annihilate said variant and other variants this monster keeps making and now with kids and teens getting vaccinating, let's hope this year will be the end because another year will be too much

CNN has a great article on the history and potential of the mRNA technology.  Including why they were able to produce the vaccines so quickly.  Perhaps if you or your Q still have doubts about the speed or safety of the vaccines the information will help.

Hello,  I'm 25 years old and I'm up to 6 weeks pregnant. Luckily I caught it on time and on Monday I'm having my 2nd meeting with the ginecologysts that will get me the set of pills I need to take.   Needless to say I don't want this to happen ever again. May it count as a big lesson,   My concern here is that on that same Monday 7th I also have appointment to get the first dose of covid vaccine. I searched everywhere on the Internet and found nobody wondering about whether abortion pills + the vaccine might be contraindicated.   I'm a bit scared of it being dangerous. If I cancel the vaccine appointment I don't know when Ill get another date to get it administered.  I forgot to ask the ginecologyst and will inquire on Monday but I'd like to know beforehand, what to expect.  Does anybody have info or advice on this? Thank you so much.

If you're on the fence about getting the vaccine, this article on how new strains of COVID are killing mothers and babies in Brazil and India is pretty sobering. If you've gotten the vaccine and have family members and friends who are freaking out about it, show them this article.   [Link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-is-killing-hundreds-of-pregnant-women-and-babies-in-brazil-11622113201?mod=e2tw) if you want to read the whole thing.   Some highlights:  &gt;More than a hundred pregnant women are dying from Covid-19 every  month in Brazil, more than twice the rate last year, according to  government figures—a tragedy researchers largely blame on [the P.1 variant of the virus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-covid-19-variant-spreads-across-south-america-in-warning-to-world-11619611204?mod=article_inline)  that first emerged in the Amazon and overwhelmed hospitals. In total,  more than 800 expectant and postpartum mothers in Brazil have died from  the disease since the pandemic began.   &gt;   &gt;At least 1,000 pregnant  women have died from complications related to Covid-19 in the Americas,  according to an estimate from the Pan American Health Organization  (PAHO) Tuesday, based on data from 24 countries. Pregnant women in  Brazil face the highest risk of dying from the disease in the region, it  said.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\]   &gt;   &gt;At least 579 babies under the age of 1 have died from Covid-19 in  Brazil since the start of the pandemic. Hundreds of babies are being  delivered prematurely to save their sick mothers. Others perish in the  womb, starved of oxygen as their mothers gasp for air, or contract the  disease and die in the first months of life.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\]   &gt;   &gt;Research from  around the world has shown that pregnant women are at greater risk from  Covid-19. A large study by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention late last year found pregnant women were 70% more likely to  die than women of the same age who weren’t pregnant.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\]   &gt;   &gt;“What’s happening in Brazil is so concerning,” said Neel Shah, an  obstetrician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. “I can  only imagine the degree of fear when the government comes out and says  there is a new strain and it seems to be impacting pregnant people  differently.”   &gt;   &gt;In India, where new strains have also led to a [devastating recent wave](https://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-covid-19-daily-death-toll-hits-worlds-high-11621445978?mod=article_inline)  of infections and deaths, there are also worries that pregnant women  are increasingly affected. There are no nationwide public data yet on  the total maternal and neonatal deaths due to Covid-19. But Dr. Alpesh  Gandhi, president of the Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological  Societies of India, said his organization is aware that relatively more  pregnant women are getting infected with Covid-19 and are having more  severity and complications during this second wave.   &gt;   &gt;Based on  interactions with gynecologists in different parts of India, he said  about 30% to 40% of pregnant women with Covid-19 are symptomatic in the  latest surge compared with about 15% in the previous year’s surge.

Hi there.  I'm based in Scotland, UK and have my first vaccine appointment next week (hooray!). I'll be 31 weeks then, and Scotland are currently doing second vaccines 8-12 weeks after the first.  I'm feeling a bit anxious about the possibility of having the second dose very close to my due date, as I'm concerned about having bad side effects while in labour. I'm considering pushing the second appointment back to a point where I'll hopefully be post partum, but then obviously the sooner I get it the sooner I'll have more protection.  I was just wondering if anyone has experience of getting the vaccine very close to their due date and whether it caused any issues?  I won't know which vaccine I'll get until the first appointment, but judging from other people in my age group it's most likely to be Pfizer or possibly Moderna.

Hey guys! Bit of a different post but I felt the need to make it.  I know a lot of people are scared to get vaccinated. Even those who wouldn’t consider themselves anti-vaccine. Which I totally understand— we don’t know the longterm effects. However, I’m sure we can agree that we need to be vaccinated if we want life to go back to normal. Because of that, I decided I wanted to share my experience getting vaccinated to help ease your mind. The sign-in process is going to be different at every facility, so I won’t go over that.  The vaccine is injected into the deltoid muscle, which is a shoulder muscle that sits at the top of your arm. The injection took less than 2 seconds and the pain was minimal. It probably would’ve been painless had I not done a shoulder and arm workout the day before, but I wasn’t thinking.  After getting my vaccine, I went and found an empty chair to sit in and wait 15 minutes before I could leave. The reason why they have you wait, is so if you have any negative reaction, a nurse will be able to assist you immediately. I have no pre-existing physical health conditions and only seasonal allergies, so I didn’t have any issues.   My arm is pretty sore now, after the fact. If the pain gets worse, you are allowed to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen. You should avoid arm and shoulder workouts, before and after, and try not to sleep on the side you get the vaccine in.  If anything else develops, I’ll be sure to update this post. I got the Pfizer vaccine, but the facility I went to also gives out Moderna vaccines. If you have any questions, don’t be afraid to ask.  EDIT: As promised, I am updating this post because I have new symptoms: I feel a bit nauseous and not achy, but my body feels weak. Fever-like symptoms are not unusual. You can develop COVID-like symptoms, but of course the vaccine doesn’t give you the virus.

So around 45 days ago I tapered from around 4 MG a day to .5 in around a week, stayed at .5 for a week or so then pushed it down to .25, then in between .06 and .125 for a couple weeks before jumping off. Tapering that fast wasn’t fun to be honest, but I just pushed myself to my physical and mental limits and here I am. It’s been 5 days and nothing has intensified, if anything it’s starting to get better lol. Just wanting to know what to expect from here

Hello guys,   I was chatting with this women for a little less than a week, we had lots in common. After a few days she would call me “babe,love, honey” send me kissy emojis, tell me I’m hot etc.   I got a bunch of anxiety from all of this due to my last relationship with my ex gf who did the EXACT same thing at first chat. I called this women up bc I wanted to be upfront and told her this gives me anxiety just being engulfed with all this type of babe talk after just 1 week of talking. She told me “you’re overthinking” to which I felt she was being dismissive? I felt I spoke with my therapist and she agrees more than likely it was her way of luring me and manipulating me.   For future reference, how do I tell if women are being genuine or if i am being love bombed?

Hello,  I posted a few weeks ago about how my husband won’t get the covid vaccine and we’re expecting our second baby this summer. Here’s the link to the original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/ngafsq/pregnant_and_husband_wont_get_vaccinated/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf  I got a lot of mixed answers and am still not sure how to move forward. I am harbouring a lot of bad feelings towards my husband for his decision not to vaccinate, I think about it almost every day and really resent him for it. We are seeing a therapist but not often due to scheduling  and pandemic stuff. We have an appointment next week and I’ve been thinking about bringing up the vaccine topic. He refuses to talk about it with me at all anymore, and part of me feels like having a “referee” there to help us navigate the problem would be beneficial. But then part of me fears he will be angry , or feel cornered/ambushed and nothing good would come of it anyway. What should I do ?? Should I find a way to get over it, or stand up for what I believe is right ?

I live in Germany, they live in the UK. They've all been fully vaccinated, I've only just had my first dose even with an asthma risk because Germany is slow with vaccination. 3 grandparents have died in the time I've not been allowed to travel because of covid. I've not mourned them, I've not had a chance to grieve.  Now I'm going to be fully vaccinated on the 22nd of June and I'm planning to go to the UK for my sister wedding on the 17th of July which has been postponed twice because of covid.  My 2yr old daughter hasn't met them in person since she was 3months old. They've missed so much and she hasn't formed any relationship with them. I miss my family dearly, I miss my mum, and they can't wait to see me again.   Germany just banned all travel to and from the UK because of the Indian Variant of covid.  The level of anxiety I'm currently experiencing is making me sick. I am going to just assume this will likely cancel my plans to see my family and I'll be missing the wedding.   How is anyone meant to cope with this.

I know I am not the only one this has happened to, because of the multiple lockdowns this year in Ontario this year. This is unfair to pregnant mothers, and we should not be penalized for obeying Government restrictions. This originally became an issue with CERB back in March 2020. The quick fix that was made still doesn't help anyone who was laid off in 2021. TLDR at the bottom. Here is what happened to me:  I live in Ontario, and I’m currently 9 months pregnant. On December 31st 2020, I was laid off due to the second COVID-19 lockdown put in place by the Government of Ontario. I applied for EI right away.  I had heard that because I was due to have a baby in the same 52 week period as my initial claim, my maternity leave benefits would be combined with my original EI claim, thus cutting my maternity/paternity leave benefit period in half. I understand that this is an issue that was supposed to be rectified by an hour credit when COVID-19 originally surfaced and CERB was introduced.  I called Service Canada in early January to speak to someone about what my options were at that time. I needed to make sure that when I had my baby in early June, I would qualify for a full year of benefits, not just 6 months. The representative told me I needed to work 120 hours between January and June to resubmit a new maternity leave claim and qualify for the standard full year of benefits. It also states this on the Service Canada website, “you only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll get a **one-time credit of 480 insured hours to help you meet the required 600 insured hours of work**”.  When the lockdown was lifted in March 2021, I went back to work part time and was able to work approximately 143 hours before Ontario was placed in **a third lockdown** and I was forced to stop working again. I reported this when filing my EI reports so that my loss in income was still supplemented. This is what the person told me to do when I called in January, since I could work part time and remain on EI.  In early May, I called Service Canada again, to see what my next step was to make sure that I was able to submit a new maternity leave claim once the baby is born. I was told that unfortunately my one time credit had **already been used** for my initial claim in December since the credit was applied to **everyone's account** once the policy was implemented back in September 2020. I did not need the credit at that time. I had worked the required amount of hours to qualify for EI, and the credit should not have been applied for me in December.  I was also told that there is no record of my conversation with the person I spoke to in January 2021, because the calls were actually not recorded. I even contacted Telus and was able to get the exact date and time of that call, but it appears the person I spoke to in January left no notes on my file of our conversation, and there is no record of her telling me I would only need 120 hours. Apparently they don't actually record your calls, even though the automation says it may be recorded, because they are dealing with SIN information...  The representative I spoke to in March empathized with me, and suggested I write to the Office for Client Satisfaction. She said there is no way to reverse the credit, or move it to a new claim. When the baby is born, I have to request to switch to maternity benefits, and as it stands, I am only eligible to receive benefits up until December 2020 due to my original claim. My baby will only be 6 months old at that time. I cannot financially support our family without the benefits, so as it stands, I really have no idea what I'm going to do.  If you are in the same boat, please file a complaint with both your local MP, and online with the Office for Client Satisfaction at Service Canada. They need to know this is an issue affecting women in Ontario. We should be entitled to our full maternity benefits, regardless of whether we were on EI due to COVID lockdowns.  TDLR: I was laid off during Ontario's second COVID-19 lockdown. Because I filed for EI within the same 52 week period as when I was supposed to go on Maternity Leave, my Maternity benefits will now end 6 months after my baby is born... If you are in the same boat, please file a complaint with your local MP, and online with the Office for Client Satisfaction at Service Canada. They need enough people to push them to make another change.

Tamayo Marukawa, minister in charge of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, previously announced that the organizers are considering inoculating all the volunteers. But Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the organizing committee, admitted on June 10, “It will probably be difficult to (vaccinate) them all.” The organizing committee plans to use vaccine doses provided for free by the International Olympic Committee to inoculate about 9,000 volunteers who will likely come into contact with athletes, according to government sources.  The organizing committee also expects that some 7,500 volunteers who are health care workers or senior citizens will receive shots in the government’s vaccination program and that about 4,600 will likely be inoculated at their workplaces, the sources said. But the organizing committee has yet to find a way to vaccinate the remaining 50,000 or so volunteers, according to the sources.  **06/09** - [**From The Mainichi - Japan will face 4th virus emergency even if all elderly vaccinated by July's end: Analysis.**](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210610/p2a/00m/0na/002000c) According to the model, even if vaccination programs progress, the size of coronavirus outbreaks would be diminished only among older people, with no significant impact on the pace of transmission among those aged 0 to 59. Patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms would primarily comprise middle-aged people, and the number of infections would be about five times that of previous levels if the hospital bed occupancy rate remains about the same. This is because the proportion of patients who do not develop severe symptoms is higher among the middle-age group than the elderly. [...] Regarding the potentially more transmissible L452R coronavirus variant initially found in India, Nishiura estimated its infectivity to be 1.78 times that of conventional strains. He forecasts that more than 50% of coronavirus cases in Japan would be attributed to that variant by mid-July.  **06/09** - [**From The Japan Times - How the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is being held during the pandemic: What we know.**](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/tokyo-2020-games-faq/)  **06/09** - [**From Nikkei Asia - OPINION - Old-fashioned tourism will never return.**](https://asia.nikkei.com/Opinion/Old-fashioned-tourism-will-never-return) The current crisis teaches us, in particular, that travel of all kinds -- especially international travel -- will have to be infinitely more regulated in order to avoid the spread of pandemics in the long term, to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and to avoid harming the protection of our heritage and natural areas. For example, it would be reasonable not to increase business travel, not to pile up in low-cost planes, not to see any more low-cost housing on the sea in the Venetian lagoon, nor millions of tourists on Thai beaches or in the streets and temples of Kyoto. Coming from Asia or America to Europe will therefore become more difficult. Conversely, coming to Asia from the rest of the world, for the simple pleasure of tourism, will necessarily be limited.  **06/09** - [**From Nikkei Asia - Japan faces likely fall vote as Suga waits for COVID recovery.**](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-faces-likely-fall-vote-as-Suga-waits-for-COVID-recovery) Suga's current term as president of the LDP expires at the end of September. The prime minister has previously said he will hold a general election before then, and looks to gauge the public's confidence in his pandemic response through the vote. Some in the LDP have floated the idea that if opposition parties submit a motion of no confidence during the current session, the lower house of parliament should be dissolved immediately. But holding an election soon risks spreading the virus, and Suga will not take such action, sources have told Nikkei.  **06/09** - [**From The Asahi Shimbun - Officials growing confident about letting spectators attend Olympics.**](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14368925) Government officials and Olympic organizers are expressing growing confidence that spectators will attend the Tokyo Summer Games, given the quicker pace of COVID-19 vaccinations and the declining number of infections in the capital. An official decision on spectators is expected around June 20, when the current state of emergency for the novel coronavirus pandemic is set to expire in Tokyo. [...] Experts on infectious diseases have consistently raised concerns about allowing in too many people to Olympic events. Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the novel coronavirus, has called for reducing the scale of the Olympics and to also consider allowing in only a minimum number of spectators. Many health experts also say the Olympics cannot be compared with professional baseball and soccer games. They say that a much wider spectrum of fans will attend the Olympics, and if they all start moving about because of the various events, the risk of outbreaks would increase.  **06/09** - [**From Kyodo News - Olympic body says visitors will not be tracked real time by GPS.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/2c63d36ec0a4-olympic-body-says-visitors-will-not-be-tracked-real-time-by-gps.html) Toshiro Muto told reporters that everyone entering Japan from abroad, including athletes, officials and media members, will be required to submit plans of their first 14 days in the country and turn on the GPS function on their smartphones. "If we have to monitor the movements all the time, it would require manpower...when there are problems, I think it is important to have the GPS function to allow visitors to make sure they did not do anything wrong," Muto said. He said use of the system, already agreed on by Olympic officials around the world, will allow the organizers to confirm afterward that the visitors followed the plans they submitted.  **06/09** - [**From Kyodo News - Japan to lift COVID-19 quasi-emergency in 3 prefectures.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/b04c0ab18a41-japan-to-lift-covid-19-quasi-emergency-in-3-prefectures.html) The Japanese government plans to lift the COVID-19 quasi-state of emergency in three prefectures after this weekend as scheduled as infections are declining, officials said Wednesday. "We will consult with experts and make a decision regarding Gunma, Ishikawa and Kumamoto as early as tomorrow as we continue to watch the situation with a strong sense of caution," Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Manabu Sakai told a press conference.  **06/09** - [**From Kyodo News - Suga vows to finish vaccinating Japan's population by November.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/71bca85c4b65-japan-pm-aims-to-cut-olympic-visitors-finish-vaccination-by-nov.html) Japan has a population of roughly 126 million, less than 4 percent of which had been fully inoculated as of Tuesday, a pace that is gradually picking up but still much slower than other industrialized nations including Britain and the United States. The actual number of people eligible for shots in Japan is smaller, as Pfizer Inc.'s COVID-19 vaccine has been approved for use on people aged 12 and older, while Moderna Inc.'s has been cleared for ages 18 and up.  **06/08** - [**From NHK News - Companies, colleges to help in vaccine rollout.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210608_33/) The government will allow companies to inoculate their employees starting on June 21st. More than 400 firms have applied. East Japan Railway Company plans to give two shots to 22,000 train operators by the end of the year. Kansai Electric Power Company will have five doctors who usually work at the head office and nuclear power plants administer vaccines to its employees. At least 8 colleges across Japan intend to set up inoculation sites. Keio University in central Tokyo aims to give shots to about 50,000 staff members and students.  **06/08** - [**From Kyodo News - Japan mulls vaccinating all 70,000 Tokyo Games volunteers.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/ed6c449d74e2-breaking-news-japan-mulls-vaccinating-all-tokyo-games-volunteers-minister.html) Japan is considering vaccinating about 70,000 volunteers for the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, while thousands of media members will be tracked by a global positioning system when they are under mandatory quarantine after entering the country to improve the safety of the major event amid the coronavirus pandemic, officials said Tuesday.  **06/07** - [**From The Asahi Shimbun - Chiba governor: No good reason to let spectators attend Olympics.**](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14367402) In what is believed to be his first public opinion on the issue, Kumagai, who took office in April, said on his blog that if spectators are allowed, he “will not be able to ask residents to refrain from crossing prefectural borders and to avoid nonessential outings during the Summer Games.” He asked the central government and Olympic organizing officials to explicitly recognize this point. The governor also compared watching the Olympics with visiting hometowns to see family members for the first time in a year or traveling with a growing 5-year-old child.  **06/04** - [**From Kyodo News - Japan to extend quarantine for travelers from Britain to 6 days.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/91303a7801e3-japan-to-extend-quarantine-for-travelers-from-britain-to-6-days.html) Those who have been to Britain within 14 days of arrival will be required to stay at a government-designated facility and be tested twice for coronavirus starting from Monday, the government said. Travelers from the European country will join those arriving from other countries, such as India and Bangladesh, subject to an extended quarantine as Japan has been strengthening its border controls. [...] The British government has been planning to lift COVID-19 restrictions in England on June 21, but the outlook has become increasingly uncertain with the recent spread of the variant in the country.  **06/03** - [**From The Asahi Shimbun - Suga expected to take shot at election based on vaccine success.**](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14364564) **Suga has said he would dissolve the Lower House before his term as LDP president ends on Sept. 30. That has led to speculation that a dissolution would happen soon after the Paralympics close on Sept. 5.** Those close to Suga have said that if the LDP emerges victorious in the Lower House election, Suga would likely win a second term as LDP president in an uncontested election. But other party sources noted that the general public has become fed up with the repeated state of emergency declarations to deal with COVID-19, and that a successful Olympics and expanded vaccine program may not be enough to ensure an LDP electoral victory.  **06/02** - [**From NHK News - EU agrees to allow non-essential travel from Japan.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210603_05/) European Union member nations have agreed to re-add Japan to their list of countries from which non-essential travel is allowed amid the coronavirus pandemic. The current list includes seven countries, including Australia and South Korea. Japan was removed in January following a surge in cases. The agreement was reached at an ambassador-level meeting on Wednesday. It could be formally adopted as early as this week. Sources familiar with the matter say the agreement was reached based on the situation in Japan which members saw as stable compared to EU countries. But immigration control is left to each EU member, and each country can decide whether to demand negative COVID-19 test certificates for travelers from Japan, and require them to undergo a period of quarantine. The EU also plans to introduce a uniform vaccination certificate system in July as it prepares to gradually lift travel restrictions ahead of the summer tourism season.  **06/02** - [**From Kyodo News - COVID-19 vaccine shots given to over 10 million, or 8%, in Japan.**](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/06/32f7a04fe9c6-more-than-10-million-in-japan-received-covid-19-vaccinations.html) **A total of 4,653,566 medical personnel and 5,734,023 people aged 65 and over had received at least one shot of vaccine as of Tuesday, equivalent to 8 percent of the country's population of 126 million. Of them, around 3.6 million people, equivalent to roughly 3 percent of the population, were fully vaccinated after receiving a second shot. The figure includes 3.13 million medical personnel and around 470,000 senior citizens.**  **06/02** - [**From NHK News - 10,000 people withdraw as Olympic volunteers.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210602_29/) The withdrawal of volunteers began in February after then organizing committee chairman Mori Yoshiro came under criticism for his remarks taken as derogatory to women. Even after Mori resigned from the post to take responsibility for his remarks, more volunteers continued to withdraw, citing other factors such as fears of infection or changes in their own working environment  **06/02** - [**From NHK News - Okinawa hospitals forced to limit patients.**](https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/20210602_22/) In Okinawa, hospital beds for coronavirus carriers were 97.9 percent full as of Tuesday. Beds for other patients were 93.5 percent occupied. Nanbu Medical Center &amp; Children's Medical Center in Haebaru Town has declared itself in a state of emergency, and announced it will impose daily caps on outpatients and inpatients through June 20.  **06/01** - [**From The Asahi Shimbun - Spectators may need negative COVID-19 test to enter venues.**](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14362919) The plan would obligate spectators to undergo PCR tests in advance and show the certificates obtained within one week of entry to an Olympic venue. People who received vaccine shots will be exempted from the requirement, but they will need to show their vaccination certificates instead, according to the officials.   **06/01** - [**From The Mainichi - Japan to start COVID-19 vaccinations at workplaces on June 21.**](https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20210601/p2g/00m/0na/035000c) The move comes at a time when Japan has been lagging behind other developed countries in its inoculation program partly due to the difficulty in securing venues for vaccinations and failure to procure enough doses from abroad.  ##**MONTHLY SUMMARY**    **May 2021 Summary - Confirmed Cases: 747,457 - Deaths: 13,073**  &gt;- [Japan expanded COVID-19 state of emergency, and extended it to the end of May.](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/05/39890da131f6-urgent-tokyo-metropolitan-govt-eyes-extension-of-covid-19-emergency.html)   &gt;- [The IOC announced plans to provide Tokyo Olympic athletes with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses.](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2021/05/e1435f6911ca-breaking-news-ioc-to-provide-tokyo-olympic-athletes-with-pfizer-covid-19-vaccines.html)   &gt;- [Prime Minister Suga announced Japan would be aiming for 1 mil.

Senior officials from Suga's LDP "have made clear that the lower house will be dissolved if we submit" a no-confidence motion, "so we can't," Edano said. Submitting a no-confidence motion at the end of the regular Diet session, which ends on June 16 this year, had been an annual ritual of opposition lawmakers until the pandemic.

Odisha Chief Secretary Suresh Chandra Mohapatra made the announcement on Sunday, he said, "Though the positivity rate of COVID-19 has dropped in the state, we are still under the risk of the infection. Therefore, the state government has decided to extend the ongoing lockdown by 16 days."  "There will be a lockdown throughout the state with effect from 5 am of June 1 till 5 am on June 17. There will be a complete shutdown on weekends. Groceries stores and shops will be allowed to open from 7 am to 11 am in the morning from Monday to Friday. But on weekends, they will be closed," he said.   The Chief Secretary also added that the movement of goods and services under the essential category won’t be affected due to the restrictions in [Odisha](https://zeenews.india.com/india/odisha-to-include-disaster-pandemic-management-in-high-school-and-college-curriculums-2365420.html).   "During the last 25 days of lockdown, the positivity rate of COVID infection in the state has come down to around 15 percent from 25 percent. We were conducting 40 to 45 thousand tests per day till 25 days ago, but as of today around 70,000 tests are being conducted but the positive cases have not risen with the increase of the testing," Mohapatra further said.  Mohapatra said, “nine of the state's 30 districts, including Khurda, Cuttack, Balasore and Puri contribute 60 per cent of the total active cases.”  [**by Taboola**](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&amp;utm_source=zeemedia-zeenews-english&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=thumbnails-m:Mid%20Article%20Thumbnails:)[**Sponsored Links**](https://popup.taboola.com/en/?template=colorbox&amp;utm_source=zeemedia-zeenews-english&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=thumbnails-m:Mid%20Article%20Thumbnails:)**You May Like**[**After Rescuing Them, Firemen Realized They Weren't PuppiesWanderoam**](https://rfvtgb.wanderoam.com/worldwide/firefighters-save-puppies?utm_campaign=t-wr-saved-pups2-s-d-ww-060421z&amp;utm_medium=taboola&amp;utm_source=taboola&amp;utm_term=zeemedia-zeenews-english)  [**Dad Puts Recording Device In Kid's Hair, Catches Teacher Doing UnthinkableSizzlfy**](https://rfvtgb.sizzlfy.com/worldwide/dad-catches-teacher-ta?utm_campaign=t-sf-girl-hair-s-d-ww-261020&amp;utm_medium=taboola&amp;utm_source=taboola&amp;utm_term=zeemedia-zeenews-english)  On the vaccination front, Mohapatra said 98 percent of healthcare workers and close to 100 percent of frontline workers have so far been inoculated, adding that nearly 30 percent of people who are aged 45 and above have been vaccinated in the state.

So, the Marino Center has lifted the mask mandate and the Atleto slot booking requirement and also the 50 min time cap on the workout.  But they still need us to get tested every week.  I don't understand this.    Why the test if the vaccines are supposed to be effective?

I just went and got vaccinated which would be my first needle in 25 years due to a cripple phobia of syringes. I want you to know that your fear of getting it done, is 1000x worse than the actual event; it’s a painless 2 second moment, I promise.  I just wanted to put this out there to encourage anyone else who has the same mental battle I do. You can do it!

Hi everyone! 28.5 weeks with my first born and we’re starting to communicate our boundaries with family as far as vaccinations and visitation when our LO arrives.   Basically, no covid vaccination = no visits with baby until she’s a year old. It’s non-negotiable; however, my dad and step-mom are hesitant to receive the vaccine. (Which is baffling to me. Seems like a small price to pay to visit their first grandbaby, but whatever).   I understand everyone has their opinions about getting vaccinated or not, but my baby, my rules. I’ve been trying to research and list my reasons, which I feel I shouldn’t have to do in the first place, but I want to be as educated as possible to get my point across.   Does anyone have any articles, sources, or pieces of advice I can use to help support my argument?   I hate that I even have to convince my own father about my reasons, but unfortunately, it’s the world we live in now. Thanks!!

I’ve missed doses plenty of times but this time I won’t be home from work until 5 pm (I take it at 7-8 am). I know a lot of people here are very sensitive to any changes but the side effects aren’t a very big deal for me. I’ve taken my meds late/early tons of times with no problem. I’m just really dreading trying to sleep tonight with these brain zaps, and I don’t know what (if any) side effects I’d get from “overdosing” tomorrow morning. Thoughts?

People who refuse to get vaccinated without having a good reason, or done proper research frustrate me.   If you have a genuine concern, or a medical condition why you wouldn't get vaccinated that's fine. But don't come at me with that "but the toxins" BS. If you don't even know how these vaccines are controlled for and developed, don't come at me with "but they are unsafe!". If I explain to you why your refusal to get vaccinated is based on a lack of information, don't tell me that I said your opinion is invalid. I didn't say that, I said you are misinformed.  And don't tell me your argument is we shouldn't want to try and save everything and everyone.   You sound stupid as hell and are incredibly selfish. Don't tell me you don't use medication either. You're not sending out smoke signals are you? You're not cooking your food on a pile of wood. You're driving a car, you're eating genetically modified food, you're not some wizard living in the forest in Narnia. You use every human development which makes your life easier, except for the one that could actually save your life FFS.  Dont come at me with the hate about having a choice about your own body. You do, and I don't care what you do with it, but at least make sure your decisions are based on something and not just a stubborn act against the government. You could be a hypocrite for all I care, as long as your concerns are valid and based on real information and not on what that one weirdo on Facebook says who studies at the University of Life. Getting vaccinated against diseases is not just for you, but for the people around you that actually don't have a choice because their immune system can't handle it or whatever. And if your response to that is "we shouldn't try to save everyone" you are just a POS.

All other dates now show a higher Cumulative total than the Originally Published Total Doses Administered. May 9th for example showed as -9 yesterday is +220 today.  &amp;#x200B;  **Average Daily Doses Administered for the last few weeks** (Mon to Sun Daily Administered/7)  Week of May 24th to 30th: 13,756 (Originally Published numbers would give an average of 14,832)  Week of May 17th to 23rd: 12,779 (Originally Published numbers would give an average of 12,948)  Week of May 10th to 16th : 13,170 (Originally Published numbers would give an average of 13,202)  Week of May 3rd to 9th : 9,775 (Originally Published numbers would give an average of 9,962)  Week of April 26th to May 2nd : 8,734 (Originally Published numbers would give an average of 9,452)  Each are still increasing day over day as data backlog is slowly caught up. It does not look like the April 26th to May 2nd is going to catch up to what the "Originally Published" numbers would indicate would give for a daily average.  &amp;#x200B;  **Timeline of Cumulative 1st Dose milestones:**  May 26th 700,000 - 8 days - With the data backlog, we most likely passed this, if not it'll be May 27th for sure (as of May 31st, the 26th now shows as 696,761 which is up 2,444 from the day it was posted)  May 19th 600,000 - 8 days  May 11th 500,000 - 12 days (this may actually go down to May 10th when data backlog is caught up, May 10th is now showing 498,296, increased 293 since last week)  April 29th 400,000 - 9 days  April 20th 300,000 - 12 days  April 8th 200,000 - 16 days from previous  March 23rd 100,000 - 91 days from first doses administered.  &amp;#x200B;  Most Data from (unless noted elsewhere):  [https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html#reports](https://manitoba.ca/covid19/vaccine/reports.html#reports)  and  [https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html)

Hi everyone, my partner has never experienced panic attacks or severe anxiety in her life. A couple days after her second Pfizer shot, she was feeling extremely dizzy and almost fainted, and then started having a bad panic attack. This was the first time she has ever had one (she’s 26). Since then she has had several more panic attacks and her anxiety has been generally bad as well. All her other vaccine symptoms (upset stomach, headache, fever, chills) have gone away, but the anxiety is still persistent.   I’ve read stories on here of people who have had panic attacks following their shots, so I’m partially thinking it could be due to an inflammatory response triggered by the shot? Am I way off base for thinking this? For those that have experienced something similar, how long did this last for you, and was there anything you did that helped ease your anxiety? I’ve dealt with panic attacks and anxiety my entire life so seeing her go through this for the first time is breaking my heart.  6/8 Edit: partner is feeling much better and hasn’t had a panic attack in several days now. To anyone else going through it hang in there! What helped her was staying hydrated.

This is a hypothetical question that I'd like to get an actual medical opinion on. This is for a work of fiction, so let's say out hypothetical person survives to integrate into modern society and work backwards from there. So feel free to suspend your disbelief a bit and tell me about what you think, this is essentially sci-fi with a heavy basis in reality, but it does not have to cleave perfectly to reality.  So this scenario: time travel is possible. A healthy 17 year old girl is brought from the year 1400 to 2021 as part of a government program that has all the money, facilities, and research needed to pull this off. Obviously major issues of ethics and consent if this were a real thing but it's to drive a plot, so we can put a pin in that for now.  So if you were leading the medical team for this girl, what would her care look like? What would you want her vaccinated against first? What tests would be done? How would she be exposed to modern foods? How would you design her surroundings to prioritize her health and reduce shock? What other considerations would you take into account?   &amp;#x200B;  Remember that you can be creative with this. I'm genuinely curious as to how an actual medical professional would approach this situation. Thanks in advance!

**Background info:**  I work for a medium sized company. Recently, the boss sent out an email saying that they would begin requiring proof of COVID vaccination status for *only* one specific job function. This function is the primary role of about 3 people at the company, and an optional role for the rest of us. (i.e. - I can volunteer to be a part of the event, but only 3 people are actually employed specifically to facilitate the event.)  Two out of those three people were not previously vaccinated because they wanted to wait until the vaccines have received full FDA licensing. They are currently defined as "unapproved" on the FDA website and are granted use under Emergency Use Authorization. Those two people are now planning to get the vaccine *only* because they feel coerced by their employer. (My understanding from browsing this sub is that this is probably legal, albeit morally questionable.)  The employer did stipulate that anyone could "opt-out" for any reason and that would not affect employment status, but they are obviously hoping to apply disproportionate pressure to the 3 individuals affected. The two that are hesitant have no wish to hinder company progress or force the company to hire new people to facilitate the event, but they feel their options are limited.  The company is based in North Carolina.  **My question:**  Would it be legal/possible for these two affected individuals to have a document drawn up saying that:  1. They are only getting the unapproved injection for their job and would otherwise not choose to get it *until it is fully licensed*. 2. The employer assumes full liability for any side effects that impact quality of life. (Including a provision that a medical doctor must conclude that these side effects are in fact linked to the vaccine.)  I know the likelihood of my employer actually signing this agreement is low (I sure wouldn't sign it) but I'm asking if a lawyer would agree to draw up such a document. My thinking is that the request to sign it would also serve as part of a paper trail in case they feel their employment is in jeopardy in the future.  **Note:**  I want to be clear that this is not about whether these individuals agree with the practice of vaccination or not. They *are not* anti-vax by any description, they are just cautious about what they inject into their bodies and do not wish to do so unless the FDA has issued full approval.

I have a friend visiting from another country and that's the vaccine he has. Would love to be able to take him to tonight game.

It was actually a callback, first time in-person auditioning since the world shut down. And it was literally just reactions, *not even any dialogue.* The second I got in the room with the casting directors (one was my reader), and the project’s directors (on zoom of all things), the nerves RUSHED BACK and I ended up making myself look like a fucking idiot instead of doing a normal job. Yknow. Like a normal person.   Idk why I’m posting this. I think I’m just venting. I haven’t been acting *in almost over 2 years* while covid’s been a thing. And I live in Colorado so the scene is fucked anyway, there’s some *shite* that comes through my agents office, mostly commercials and training videos, I just... ugh. In the four years+ I’ve been signed with them, I’ve gotten exactly two jobs that were like *actual acting*. A real story, emotions to feel, goals for each scene, yknow?? But they’re all Air Force training videos that won’t see the light of day. There’s *nothing* here that lets me flex actual acting, which is another reason I’m just in a weird headspace or something, I... I... I... just don’t know.  *Fuck.* I can’t believe I screwed that audition up so bad since it was my first opportunity for some decent work in what feels like a very long time, and I know I’m not gonna get it. I need to move to LA but don’t have the money. I have no connections with students to try and get into those films, I just... idk. Am I even a good actor? Should I be doing this? Cause I love doing it, but that was some absolute dogshit I just did in that room.  *I’m pissed off and bitter and all I wanna do is act and make stories, and I can’t even do that right apparently.* Anyway, sorry for the long post. Just needed to get that out there.

68.09$ at the moment. How do I know that.   You've seen the news about the cure from cancer appear time to time, and then just disappear into nowhere. My story will answer the question why.   It happened 10 years ago. (I'm from Russia and currently live in the USA, excuse me for my English)  My dad came back from work, and told us, that he just met his ex coworker, who was a scientist, that went to Europe years before that to work for a private company that was developing a cancer vaccine.   He told us, that now they have a vaccine, based on the new method that works on a DNA. So, apparently, majority of cancer types (and other kinds of genetic deceases) - information about them, and the time, when you'll have it - it's already stored in your DNA from the very beginning.  How this vaccine would work - it would go and erase the information about the cancer from your DNA.  So, he said, if anybody in our family had cancer, he could get us that vaccine for 5000 roubles. (Which was the cost of its production, and is equal 68.09$ right now) Nobody in my family had cancer, but my best friend did. She had 6 months left to live. I immediately told my dad that we should get that for her.   1 week later we got a box with 10 yellowish big capsules, and were told, that she should have 1 shot of that a day, for 10 days. Her mom was a nurse and did the shots.   After a month from that doctors told my friend, that her cancer stopped growing. After half a year they told her, that it became smaller. It was getting smaller until it completely disappeared.  She's still alive now and has a family.   Approximately at the time she got good news the private company that made the vaccine was bought up by a big corporation and the research was closed.   Now, let's look at the list of the richest corporations. The third of them is in the medical field. Drugs, insurance, hospitals, elderly care.  Why would they ever let you to have a vaccine at any cost, if it's more profitable for them to have you fighting with cancer for years, going to the doctor, consuming medicine, and using insurance? They have so much money, and make so much money, that to buy any cancer research and close it - is rather profitable.   Here we go, end of story. Very sad.

I’m Italian and just got my Covid vaccine today (yay!). It got me wondering why it sounds so much like “vacca” which means “cow” in my language. Well, turns out it’s not a coincidence:   1800, used by British physician Edward Jenner (1749-1823) for the technique he publicized of preventing smallpox by injecting people with the similar but much milder cowpox virus (variolae vaccinae), from vaccine (adj.) "pertaining to cows, from cows" (1798), from Latin vaccinus "from cows," from vacca "cow”. A mild case of cowpox rendered one immune thereafter to smallpox. The use of the term for diseases other than smallpox is due to Pasteur.

Hey everyone, happy Tuesday! I hope you feel okay and you're doing great. I'm proud of you for getting vaccinated or for booking an appointment, I know it can be tough and scary since this is so new, but you did it! So, I'm a raging emetophobe. My biggest fear in life is throwing up. I've seen quite a few people say that this vaccine made them vomit. Has anyone experienced this? If so, were you vomiting a lot? I got my first dose today and I'm genuinely terrified to do anything lmao. I refuse to eat, I'm only drinking water and gatorade, and I refuse to sleep.

I have read some posts on this Reddit pointing aggression after Lyme vaccine first dose. Our puppy is scheduled to get his last DHPP and Lyme first dose on Thursday. He also starts his first day of puppy class on Thursday evening.   I spoke to the vet office and there is no possibility of rescheduling his appointment until after 3 weeks.   Should we go ahead and get his Lyme shot on Thursday or wait for 3 weeks and then get it done? I do not want him to be stressed before his first class in a new environment . He’s also losing teeth on the daily and not eating too much.  Another thing to note is we stay in Pittsburgh,PA and there have been Lyme cases in the area. As of now we are not taking our puppy to parks or outside walks but would like to start after his DHPP rounds are done.   We are very confused.
